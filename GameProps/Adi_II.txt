<about>
A territory game.

Sow counter-clockwise in multiple laps via the next hole method.
Multilap sowing ends when there are no seeds in the next hole or
when the final seed of lap sows a hole to four seeds.

Until the final seed of a lap, any of the sower's holes that are
sown to four are captured by the sower. The non-sower does not capture
any holes.

Captures are on 4s on the final seed sown, regardless of hole owner.
If this capture leaves only 4 seeds in play, they are also taken.

A player must pass if they have no moves.
Each round ends when there neither player has a move.

To setup for the next round, each player fills as many holes as they
can. The player owns the holes that they fill for the next round.
The round starter alternates.

The game ends when one player controls 10 holes (see deviation).

Variations:

- Change number of holes required for win (GOAL_PARAM).

- Remove the en passant capture (SOW_RULE of None).

- <nolink>Adi_II::No_Rounds - not played in rounds; the games ends as soon as
one player has half the seeds.

- <nolink>Adi_II::Ba-awa has two differences from the base game.
First, it is not played in rounds with the goal to capture the most seeds.
Second, the hole owner always performs the capture--both en passant and final capture.

- <nolink>Adi_II::Motiq - Board size is 7 holes per side (but can be set to 6).
It is not played in rounds with the goal to capture the most seeds. Passing is not allowed.
Repeat turn on captures.
Player's must make seeds available to an oppenent with none;
if a player cannot, the opponent gets the seeds on the board (unfed player), and the game is over.
