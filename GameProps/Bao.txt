<about>
The starting player may choose to rearrange the seeds on their side of
the board. The opponent's side will be arranged in the same manner
from their perspective. If the player chooses to rearrange the board,
it counts as their opening move. If they do not so choose, they cannot
make a child or capture until their opponent does either.

Sow in counter-clockwise direction; if the first sow of a turn reaches
the opponent's side of the board continue in multiple laps.

Sowing the final seed of a lap to 4 on opposite side, creates a child
which will collect seeds but can't be captured. A child may not be
created with a single seed in a move that was initiated from the
player's rightmost hole. Moves may not start from children.

Cross-capture on opponent's side. On capture, take the seed initiating
the capture. Multiple captures may be made in sow direction as long as
the player's side holes are empty. Seeds from child holes may not be
captured.

Played in rounds. Each round ends when the current player does not
have a move or there is only one seed left in play without children.
The game ends when one player cannot fill a single hole.

At the start of each round, the loser puts four seeds in each hole
from the left, then any remaining seeds are put into the next hole.
The winner's side is setup exactly the same, except any extra seeds
they have are put into their store. The board is resized to the number
of holes filled. If the board size is reduced to 3 or less per side,
no children may be created.
