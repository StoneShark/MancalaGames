Second, if a player has no legal move, the unclaimed seeds go to the last mover.  Third, cycling seeds go to hole owners.\n\nWhen would the second rule apply:\n\n- If a player has seeds, they have a valid move.\n\n- If a player does not have seeds, they should have been fed; but if they couldn't be fed, they get the remaining seeds. \n\nThe second condition is not implemented."
