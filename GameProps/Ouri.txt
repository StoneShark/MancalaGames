<about>
Sow counter-clockwise. You must share seeds if your opponent has none.
Moves may only be made from singletons when all holes are singletons
or empty.

Multiple capture on 2s and 3s back along sow path on your opponents
side of the board.

If a grand slam capture is done, the capturer gets a repeat turn. If
they are unable to share seeds, the game ends.

If your opponent has no seeds and you cannot share, they get your
remaining seeds.
</about>
<deviation>
According to the rules, there are three end game conditions: First, an
unfed player gets the remaining seeds. Second, if a player has no
legal move, the unclaimed seeds go to the last mover.  Third, cycling
seeds go to hole owners.

When would the second rule apply:

- If a player has seeds, they have a valid move.

- If a player does not have seeds, they should have been fed; but if
they couldn't be fed, they get the remaining seeds.

The second condition is not implemented.
