<about>
Sow counter-clockwise via the multi-lap next-hole method (MLAPS of
LAPPER_NEXT).

While either player is sowing, both players capture all holes sown to
4 on their side of the board. Specifically, the non-sower may capture
seeds from holes sown to 4 on their own side of the board.

The game is over when one player does not have a move on their turn.

The final four seeds can easily end up in holes that prevent any final caputre.
Such games can be ended with either Game menu command:
End Game - seeds still on the board go to hole owners; or
Quit Game - seeds still on the board are divvied between the players.

Goal: capture more than half of the seeds.

The original written rules do not specify an end game condition.
Any of the following options may be used to force a cleaner end game:
<ol><li> PICKEXTRA of PICKLASTSEEDS;
<li>PICKEXTRA of PICK2XLASTSEEDS;
<li> END_COND of SEEDS_LIMIT with END_PARAM = 4;
<li>END_COND of SEEDS_LIMIT with <nolink>END_PARAM = 8.
</ol>How the final seeds are allocated for the last two options
may be controlled with UNCLAIMED.

All still result in a game that is fair and the starting player
still has a significant advantage.
For option 2, the starter wins nearly 100% of the time.
Option 3 is the fairest in terms of starter, but they still have a near 70% chance to win.
