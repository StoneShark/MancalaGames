<about>
Sow counter-clockwise via the multi-lap next-hole method (MLAPS of
LAPPER_NEXT).

While either player is sowing, both players capture all holes sown to
4 on their side of the board. Specifically, the non-sower may capture
seeds from holes sown to 4 on their own side of the board.

The game is over when one player does not have a move on their turn.

Goal: capture more than half of the seeds.
