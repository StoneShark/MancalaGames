<about>
A multi-lap mancala, sow direction is counter-clockwise.

Cross-capture when end in own hole with one seed; pick own seed on capture.

Games end when a player has no valid move on their turn.

Goal: collect more than half the seeds.

Variations:

- Played with 6 to 10 holes and 2 to 9 seeds per hole at the start.

- <nolink>Endodoi::Rounds - use a GOAL of RND_SEED_COUNT where the winner is the first to
collect 100 total seeds.

- <nolink>Endodoi::J_Odu - limit captures to holes with 3 or fewer seeds (CAPT_MAX 3).

- Only allow moves from holes that reach
an empty hole or the opposite side of the board (Dabuda).
