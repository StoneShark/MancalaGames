<about>
A multi-lap mancala, sow direction is counter-clockwise. Cross-capture
when end in own hole with one seed; pick own seed on capture. Games
end when a player has no valid move. Goal: collect the most seeds.

Variations:

- Played with 6 to 10 holes.

- Use a GOAL of RND_SEED_COUNT where the winner is the first to
collect 100 total seeds (<nolink>Edodoi::Rounds).

- Limit captures to holes with 3 or fewer seeds (<a
href="#{J'Odu}">J'Odu</a>).

- Limit moves to holes reach the opposite side of the board or end in
empty hole (Dabuda).
