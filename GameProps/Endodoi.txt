Goal: collect the most seeds.\n\nVariations:\n\n- Played with 6 to 10 holes.\n\n- Use a GOAL of RND_SEED_COUNT where the winner is the first to collect 100 total seeds.\n\n- Limit captures to holes with 3 or fewer seeds (J'Odu).\n\n- Limit moves to holes reach the opposite side of the board or end in empty hole (Dabuda).",
