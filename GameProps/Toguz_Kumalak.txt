One seed is left in the start hole when sowing; unless there is only one seed, then it is moved forward one hole.\n\nCapture on evens.\n\nIf the final seed of a sow brings a hole to three seeds, a tuzdik is made (child) with the following restrictions: \n\n- Only one tuzdik may be made per player.\n\n- Must be in the right 8 holes on the opposite side of the board (right as viewed by the player making the child).\n\n- Tuzdiks cannot be symetrically opposite eachother. Specifically, tuzdiks may not be made in the same numbered holes:\n\n  + 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n  + 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n<nolink>Toguz Kumalak (nine pebbles) is also known as Toguz Korgool (nine dung balls). This is intended to be the rules used by the World Nomad Games.\n\nVariations:\n- Toguz Xorgol is very similar.\n- played on smaller boards where the number of seeds per hole is the same as the number holes per side.\n",
