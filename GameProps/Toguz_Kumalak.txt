<about>
A single-lap, counter-clockwise sow mancala. One seed is left in the
start hole when sowing; unless there is only one seed, then it is
moved forward one hole.

Capture on evens.

If the final seed of a sow brings a hole to three seeds, a tuzdik is
made (child) with the following restrictions:

1. Only one tuzdik may be made per player.

2. Must be in the right 8 holes on the opposite side of the board
(right as viewed by the player making the child).

3. Tuzdiks cannot be symetrically opposite eachother. Specifically,
tuzdiks may not be made in the same numbered holes:

<pre>
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
</pre>
<nolink>Toguz Kumalak (nine pebbles) is also known as Toguz Korgool
(nine dung balls). This is intended to be the rules used by the World
Nomad Games.

Variations:

- Toguz Xorgol is very similar.

- played on smaller boards where the number of seeds per hole is the
same as the number holes per side (<nolink>Toguz
Kumalak::Toguz_Kumalak_n where n is in 5 .. 8).
