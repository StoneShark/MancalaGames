<about>
Sow clockwise.  Cross capture, opposite side only. Qurs are created in
pairs on both sides of the board when a seed is sown into an empty
hole on the player's side of the board and the opposite hole contains
three seeds (no capture is made).

Variations:

- 6 or 12 board size

- play with multilap sow

- <nolink>Leyla-Gobale::Rounds: played in rounds with UMOVE style RoundFill.

Valdez describes Layli Goobalay as a very similar game with CCW sow and round fill is UMOVE but not reflected instead opposite holes have the same seed counts (not supported in Mancala Games).
