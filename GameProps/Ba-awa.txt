<about>
A territory game.

Sow in multiple-laps counter-clockwise.
Holes sown to 4 seeds are captured by the hole owner
except for the final seed of a lap then the sower captures the seeds.

If the final seed of a sow yields 4 seeds in a hole, the sower
captures them. Capture may occur on either side of the board.

Played in rounds. A round ends when there are 8 seeds on the board;
the round starter collects those 8 seeds. Hole ownership is
reallocated each round based on the number of holes each player can
fill with their collected seeds. The round starter alternates.

Goal: control at least 10 of the holes.
