Any holes sown to 4 seeds are captured by the hole owner.\n\nIf the final seed of a sow yields 4 seeds in a hole, the sower captures them. Capture may occur on either side of the board\n\nPlayed in rounds. A round ends when there are 8 seeds on the board; the round starter collects those 8 seeds. Hole ownership is reallocated each round based on the number of holes each player can fill with their collected seeds. The round starter alternates.\n\nGoal: control at least 10 of the holes.\n",
