<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in multiple laps.
Multilap sowing ends when there is only one seed in the final
and for a final capture.

Any hole sown to 4 is captured by the sower.

The last 4 seeds are taken along with the final capture.

Played in rounds. After each round players fill as many holes as they
can with 4 seeds each. Extra seeds are placed in their store. Unfilled
holes are out of play for the round.

The game is over when one player cannot fill a single hole.
