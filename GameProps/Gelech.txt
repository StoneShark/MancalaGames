Then sow as normal. No other capture is provided.\n\nPlayed in rounds. A round ends when either player cannot move. Any seeds remaining on the board go to the last player to move.\n\nGoal: win 10 games. The Game Tally, available to be displayed via the Display menu, shows progress toward that goal.\n\nVariant:\n\n- Allow moves from holes across from singles (Huroy).",
