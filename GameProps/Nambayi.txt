A multilap Mancala, sow is counter-clockwise.

The goal is to leave the opponent without seeds for their turn.

Holes are closed on opponent side on 4s, sowing continues with those
seeds. In subsequent sowing of closed holes, own holes are skipped but
seeds for opponent's holes are taken out of play.
