<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in multilaps using the hole after the final seed sown
to continue.
Sow own store.
Repeat turn if last seed is sown into the player's own store.

If the final seed of a lap ends in an empty hole
on the player's side of the board,
capture any seeds across from it and take the final seed sown.

If the final seed of a lap ends in a player's rightmost hole
and they cannot capture the seeds across the board,
they must continue sowing with the seeds from their store.

If a player clears all of their own seeds,
they capture all their opponent's seeds that are still in play and the game ends.

Goal: capture the most seeds.
