<about>
A multi-lap, counter-clockwise sow

Bulls are made on either side of the board when sowing to 4.  Two
bulls are made if the final two seeds sow holes to 3 and 4 seeds in
either order. Moves may not start from bulls and seeds in bulls may
not be captured.

Cross-capture and pick own on capture. Multiple captures may be made
as long as the holes after the final hole sown are empty.

Variations:

- 8, 10 or 12 board size

- start patterns: CLIPPEDTRIPLES with 3 start seeds
