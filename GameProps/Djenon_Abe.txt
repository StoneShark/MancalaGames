If an opponent does not have any seeds, the current player must make seeds available if they can.\n\nCapture on 2s and 4s on either side of the board.\n\nThe game ends when a player can't share seeds or when one player doesn't have a move on their turn. Any seeds left on the board are divvied between the two players.\n",
