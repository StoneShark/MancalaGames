As long as there is a an unbroken group of holes containing 2 or 3 seeds immediately preceding the final hole sown, these holes are also captured.\n\nVariations:\n\n- board sizes from 5 - 12 holes per side\n- number of start seeds per hole, as many as 10\n- captures on various numbers of seeds\n- a single seed may not be used for capture, NOSINGLECAPT \n- any GRANDSLAM rule",
