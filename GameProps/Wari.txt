If your opponent has no seeds, you must make seeds available to them (if you can).\nCaptures are on 2s and 3s from the opponent's side (final seed sown makes either 2 or 3).  As long as there is a an unbroken group of holes containing 2 or 3 seeds immediately preceeding the final hole sown, these holes are also captured.\n\nVariations:\n\n- board sizes from 5 - 12 holes per side\n- number of start seeds per hole, as many as 10\n- captures on various numbers of seeds\n- a single seed may not be used for capture, NOSINGLECAPT \n- capturing all of your opponents seeds results in them taking your remaining seeds, GRANDSLAM of OPP_GETS_REMAIN\n- leave one seed in the start hole (SOW_START)",
