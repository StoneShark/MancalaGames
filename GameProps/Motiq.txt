<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in multiple laps. Continue lapping until the
last seed falls into an empty hole or makes a hole containing 4 seeds.

If the last seed of a lap makes 4 seeds, capture those seeds and
continue the lap sowing with the seeds in the next hole. If there are
no seeds in the next hole, the turn is over.

A round ends when one player cannot move. Seeds left on the board are
allocated to the player that performed the last move.

For the next round, holes are allocated to each player based on how
many seeds they collected in the previous round.
If there is a contested hole where each player has two seeds to fill it,
it goes to the player with fewer holes.

The game is over when one player has control of 11 holes.

Variations:

- Lahemay Waladat captures on 3s and handles round setup differently.
