After the first move, subsequent moves may only be played from holes:\n\n- that do not contain 2 seeds,\n- unless all of the player's non-empty holes contain 2, then any hole maybe played.\n\nWhen sowing, skip opponent's holes with two seeds (except on the first move).\n\nAfter opening move, cross-capture from opponents side of board but only if it contains 2 seeds; on capture, pick all of opponent's holes with 2 seeds. \n\nPlayed in Rounds. A round ends when the current player has no moves. Holes for the next round are allocated based on how many seeds each player collected in the previous round. \n\nVariations:\n\n- board size\n\n- set a game goal to the number of holes the player with fewer seeds must be able to fill to continue the game\n",
