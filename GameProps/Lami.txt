<about>
Counter-clockwise sow, multi-lap sow. After the first move, subsequent
moves may only be played from holes:

- that do not contain 2 seeds,

- unless all of the player's non-empty holes contain 2, then any hole
maybe played.

When sowing, skip opponent's holes with two seeds (except on the first
move).

After opening move, cross-capture from opponents side of board but
only if it contains 2 seeds; on capture, pick all of opponent's holes
with 2 seeds.

Played in Rounds. A round ends when the current player has no moves.
Holes for the next round are allocated based on how many seeds each
player collected in the previous round.

Variations:

- board size

- set a game goal to the number of holes the player with fewer seeds
must be able to fill to continue the game
