Any hole sown to 4 seeds is captured by the hole owner, except if the final seed of a lap sows a hole to 4, then the sower captures the seeds.\n\nPlayed in rounds. A round ends when there are not moves or the seeds are cycling the board (use the Round End menu option). Seeds left on the board go to the hole owners. To set up for a new round each player fills as many holes as they can with 4 seeds, placing extra seeds in their store.\n\nThe games ends when one player does not have sufficient seeds to fill one hole.\n",
