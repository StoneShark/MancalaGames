Any hole sown to 4 seeds is captured by the hole owner, except if the final seed of a lap sows a hole to 4, then the sower captures the seeds.\n\nPlayed in rounds. A round ends when a player has no valid moves on their turn. Seeds left on the board go to the hole owners. To set up for a new round each player fills as many holes as they can with 4 seeds, placing extra seeds in their store.\n\nThe games ends when one player does not have sufficient seeds to fill one hole.\n",
