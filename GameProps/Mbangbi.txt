Moves may only be started from holes with 2 or more seeds.  If a player does not have a move, they must pass until they do have a move or the game ends.\n\nCaptures are on 2s and 4s from the opponent's side (final seed sown makes either 2 or 4).  As long as there is an unbroken group of holes containing 2 or 4 seeds immediately preceding the final hole sown, these holes are also captured.",
