Moves may only be started from holes with 2 or more seeds.  If a player does not have a move they must pass until they do have a move or the game ends.\nCaptures are on 2s and 4s from the opponent's side (final seed sown makes either 2 or 4).  As long as there is a an unbroken group of holes containing 2 or 4 seeds immediately preceeding the final hole sown, these holes are also captured.",
