<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in single lap. Sow own store. Repeat turn if
last seed is sown into the player's own store.

Cross capture when seed lands in empty hole on your side of the board.

If you clear all of your own seeds, you capture all of your opponent's
seeds that are still in play and the game ends.

Goal: capture the most seeds (more than half).

Variations:

- Ending 2: End the game when your opponent does not have any seeds at
the end of your own turn (END_COND CLEARED_OPP).

- Ending 3: End when one player has collected more than half of the
seeds or the board is clear and each player has half the seeds
(END_COND NO_ADDTL).

- <nolink>CrossCapt::Two - Use multilap sowing but only when the final
seed lands in a occupied hole on your own side of the board. If your
opponent does not have any seeds, you must share, if you can.
Otherwise the game ends and the player with the most seeds wins.

- <nolink>CrossCapt::Three - Use multilap sowing but only when the
final seed lands in an occupied on your opponent's side of the board.
The game ends when your own holes are cleared.

- <nolink>CrossCapt::Four - Cross capture initiated from a single seed
on your opponent's side of the board.

- <nolink>CrossCapt::Five - Cross capture initiated from either side of
the board. The does not end until one person has collected more than
half the seeds, or the board is cleared.

- <nolink>CrossCapt::Five_No_Sides - <nolink>CrossCapt::Five but plays
may be made from any hole.

- <nolink>CrossCapt::Five_UDIR - <nolink>CrossCapt::Five but each
player's first move (including any repeat turns) are sown counter-
clockwise; the user chooses the sow direction for subsequent moves.

- capture side of own, opposite or both.

- take the final seed sown into an empty hole on your own side of the
board even when there is no capture (XCPICKOWN ALWAYS).

- sow in multiple-laps (LAPPER) possibly limiting lap continuing to
one side of the board.

- sow both stores.
