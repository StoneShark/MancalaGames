<about>
A multi-lap mancala played in rounds. The goal is to claim ownership
of at least 10 holes. Each player initially owns the holes on their
side of the board. Owners of holes are updated at the start of each
round based on the number of seeds captured in the previous round.

Captures are on 4s on the final sown seed by the sower (regardless of
hole owner). The seeds of any hole sown to 4 are captured by the
hole's owner (regardless of sower). On capture, if there are 4 or
fewer seeds left on the board the capture takes them as well.

If, at the start of your turn, your opponent has no seeds; you must
make seeds available to them, if you can, otherwise the game is over.
