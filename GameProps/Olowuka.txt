<about>
Multilap sow, but only if final hole contains four or more seeds.
Counter-clockwise.

Capture on 2s and 3s on opponent's side.
Grand Slam capture of more than one hole is permitted but
the righmost hole (from sower perspective) is not captured.
A single hole capture is performed.
</about>
<deviation>
The grand slam capture might not be exactly how the game is played;
it could be a fixed left hole (hole position 0) that is not captured.
