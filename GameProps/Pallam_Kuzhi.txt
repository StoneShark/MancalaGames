<about>
Sow counter-clockwise via the multi-lap next-hole method (MLAPS of
LAPPER_NEXT).

While either player is sowing, both players capture all holes sown to
4 on their side of the board. Specifically, the non-sower may capture
seeds from holes sown to 4 on their own side of the board.

When the hole from which a new lap should start is empty, capture any
seeds in the hole following the empty hole. That is, captures are made
when the hole after the hole in which the final seed of a lap was
sown, is empty and there are seeds in the hole 'two out' from the last
sown seed.

Played in ROUNDS. Each round ends when the current player does not
have any playable holes. Round setup is via the
<a href="game_params.html#rf_ehm">Empty Hole Method</a> of
ROUND_FILL from each player's left.
After the next round setup unfilled holes are
out of play. The players alternate starting rounds.

The game is over when either player cannot fill a single hole.

Variations:

- 4 to 6 start seeds.

- Any en passant capture (SOW_RULE) or no en passant captures.

- Other options for ROUND_STARTER and ROUND_FILL.

- Change the number of holes that a round loser must be able to fill to continue playing (GOAL_PARAM).

- <nolink>Pallam_Kuzhi::No_Rounds is a simpler game played with only 4 seeds per hole at the start and not played in rounds.

- See Olinda, Pallanguli and Pandi.
