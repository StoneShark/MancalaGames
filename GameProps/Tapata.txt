If the final seed would be placed on their own side of the board, it is instead put into the first of the opponents holes. This first sow for each player is a single lap sow.\n\nSubsequent moves must end in an empty hole or reach opponent's side of the board and are multi-lap sows.\n\nSeeds are taken out of play via cross-capture on opponent's side.\n\nVariations:\n- any start pattern\n- any allow rule\n- see Sadeqa\n",
