<about>
The goal is to deprive the opponent of seeds.

Sow counter-clockwise.

The opening move for each player is limited to their right side holes.
If the final seed would be placed on their own side of the board, it
is instead put into the first of the opponents holes. This first sow
for each player is a single lap sow.

Subsequent moves must end in an empty hole or reach opponent's side of
the board and are multi-lap sows.

Seeds are taken out of play via cross-capture on opponent's side.

Variations:

- any start pattern

- any allow rule
