Do not sow into your opponent's store.\nIf the last seed ends in an empty hole on your side of the board, capture any seeds from the opposite hole (CROSSCAPT). When performing a capture, take the final single seed sown as well. Pick your own seed only when opponents seeds are captured.\nIf your sow ends in your own store, repeat your turn.\n\nVariation:\n\n- Require must share (MUSTSHARE) because it removes the seed hoarding strategy.",
