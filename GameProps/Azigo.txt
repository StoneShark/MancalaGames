<about>
Sow counter-clockwise from any hole or your store
but only on your side of the board.
You may choose the number of seeds to sow from your
start hole.
If there is one seed in the start hole move it forward,
otherwise leave one seed in the start hole.

Capture on 1s, 3s and 5s across from the final hole sown.
Do multiple captures as long as holes have 1, 3 or 5 seeds
in a chain in the opposite of the sow direction.
The captures are done no matter how many seeds are in the
holes on your side of the board.

Goal: be the last player to move.

Variations:

- board sizes of 8 to 20 holes per side. <nolink>Azigo::Twenty 
allows direct play of a 20 hole board (as specified in the rules).

- when sowing from the store all seeds must be sown (PLAY_LOCS).

- remove 3s from the capture on values.

- sow both sides of the board (GAME_CLASS of Mancala) and
capture direction (CAPT_DIR) is sow direction.
</about>
<deviation 1>
The rules use a board size of 20 holes per side, a smaller
size was choosen to make games play faster.
<nolink>Azigo::Twenty is available to directly play with the original board size.
</deviation 1>
<deviation 2>
The number of store seeds are shown;
but in physical play the seeds are hidden.
</deviation 2>
<note>
All possible moves from stores are considered by the AI player,
this results in a large branching factor and makes the AI players slow.
