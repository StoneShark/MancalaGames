<about>
The starting player chooses the sow direction that they will use for
the game; the second player will use the opposite direction for the
game. Sowing is done in multiple laps from the next hole (MLAPS of
LAPPER_NEXT).

While either player is sowing, both players capture all holes sown to
4 on their side of the board. Specifically, the non-sower may capture
seeds from holes sown to 4 on their own side of the board.

When the hole from which a new lap should start is empty, capture any
seeds in the hole following the empty hole. That is, captures are made
when the hole after the hole in which the final seed of a lap was
sown, is empty and there are seeds in the hole 'two out' from the last
sown seed.

Captures continue while holes are alternately empty and occupied in
the player's sow direction. If a capture leaves 4 or fewer seeds on
the board, they are taken by the final capturer.

Played in ROUNDS. Each round ends when the current player does not
have any playable holes. Round setup is via the
<a href="game_params.html#rf_ehm">Empty Hole Method</a> of
ROUND_FILL from each player's left.
After the next round setup unfilled holes are
out of play. The players alternate starting rounds.

The game is over when either player cannot fill a single hole.

Touch Screen mode will show the right click grids, but after the first
move, the grid and left and right mouse buttons will all sow in the
direction set on the first turn.

Variations:

- 4 to 6 start seeds.

- Any en passant capture type (SOW_RULE).

- No PICKEXTRA (see deviation).

- Change the number of holes that a round loser must be able to fill to continue playing (GOAL_PARAM).

- See Pallam Kuzhi and Pandi.
