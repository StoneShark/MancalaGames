<about>
The starting player chooses the sow direction that they will use for
the game; the second player will use the opposite direction for the
game. Sowing is done in multiple laps from the next hole (MLAPS of
LAPPER_NEXT).

When the hole from which a new lap should start is empty, capture any
seeds in the hole following the empty hole. That is, captures are made
when the hole after the hole in which the final seed of a lap was
sown, is empty and there are seeds in the hole 'two out' from the last
sown seed.

Captures continue while holes are alternately empty and occupied in
Played in ROUNDS. Each round ends when the current player does not
have any playable holes. Round setup is via the
<a href="game_params.html#rf_ehm">Empty Hole Method</a> of
ROUND_FILL from each player's left.
After the next round setup unfilled holes are
out of play. The players alternate starting rounds.

The game is over when either player cannot fill a single hole.

Touch Screen mode will show the right click grids, but after the first
move, the grid and left and right mouse buttons will all sow in the
direction set on the first turn.
