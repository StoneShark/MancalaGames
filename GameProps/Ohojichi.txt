<about>
Sow counter-clockwise but only on your own side of the board. The
board is divided vertically into East and West players. When active,
the AI plays East.

Multiple capture on 4s and place captured seeds in opponents hole of
your choice. Capture is in opposite direction from sowing.

A move has the typical draw, sow and check capture phases. If there is
a capture (but not a win), another user input is accepted to identify where the
capture seeds should be put.

In this game, the number of captured seeds will always be a multiple
of 4.

Goal: clear your own side (east/west) of the board.
