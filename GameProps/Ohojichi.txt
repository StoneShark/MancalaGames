      "about": "Sow counter-clockwise but only on your own side of the board. The board is divided vertically into East and West players. When active the AI plays East.\n\nMultiple capture on 4s, but place captured seeds in opponents hole of your choice.\n\nA move has the typical draw, sow and check capture phases. If there is a capture, another user input is accepted to identify where the capture seeds should be put. The indicator for this is subtle: your store will still show your turn and you opponents holes will be highlighted for input.\n\nWhen the AI player does a capture, the AI delay is done between move/capture and seed placement; wait for the AI to finish the turn before starting your turn.\n\nIn this game, the number of captured seeds will always be a multiple of 4.\n\nGoal: clear your own side (east/west) of the board.",
