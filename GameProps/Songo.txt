If your opponent has no seeds, you must make seeds available to them (if you can).\n\nCaptures are on 2s and 4s on opponent's side (final seed sown makes either 2 or 4).  As long as there is an unbroken group of holes containing 2 or 4 seeds immediately preceding the final hole sown, the holes are also captured.\n\nVariations:\n\n- <nolink>Songo Douala: Eight start seeds. Captures on 3s added. Grand Slam rule of NOT_LEGAL or NO_CAPT. (Mancala World)\n\n- <nolink>Songo Ewondo: Sowing from player's leftmost hole has restrictions (not supported by Mancala Games). Captures on 3s added. No capture from opponents first hole (not supported). Multiple captures but only if the sow did not start with a multiple of seven seeds, then single hole capture (not supported). Grand Slam rule of NO_CAPT. (Mancala World)",
