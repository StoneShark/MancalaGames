<about>
Initial position is 72 seeds placed randomly. A human player may
choose to swap sides before either of the first two moves of the game;
the AI will not swap.

Sow is counter-clockwise in multiple-laps. Multilap sowing ends when
the final seed ends in an empty hole or for capturing. If your
opponent does not have any seeds and you have a hole with at least two
seeds, you must share one seed from a hole of your choice with 2 or
more seeds. This choice is made before your regular turn.

Multiple captures on 2s and 4s from either row. For each hole
captured, take any seeds from the hole across the board.

Played in rounds. A round ends either when the outcome cannot change
or when there are cycling seeds on the board (use the End Round menu
command).

The game ends when one player has accumulated a sum of 60 seeds more
than their opponent in a series of games.  After each game, a player
is awarded a number of seeds equal to winner seeds - loser seeds; this
sum must exceed 60 for the win.

Variations:

- The number of extra seeds goal may be set via Config Variants.

- <nolink>Leab El-ákil::Equal - An all equal start pattern with 6 seeds per hole.

- <nolink>Leab El-ákil::No_Rounds do not play multiple rounds, an all equal
start pattern with 4 seeds in each hole, the goal is to collect more than
half the seeds.

- Do not take seeds across the board from captured holes (PICKEXTRA of NONE).

- Repeat turn on capture (CAPT_RTURN).
