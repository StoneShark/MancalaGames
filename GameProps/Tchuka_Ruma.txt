      "about": "A puzzle game. There is no interaction between players; so a race game if played by two players. The goal is to remove all of your own seeds in one set of repeat turns (this is not enforced).\n\nSowing is only on your own side of the board in multiple laps. At the right edge of each sow one seed is removed from play (as if into the store) and sowing continues on the left side of the board. If sowing stops with one seed off the board (into the store), repeat turn.\n\nThe start condition for this game is solvable; many variants are not. Combinations that are solvable: 4 holes, 2 seeds; 5 holes, 7 seeds; and 12 holes, 3 seeds.\n\nVariations:\n\n- any size board\n- any number of start seeds\n- any start pattern\n- don't sow in multiple laps",
