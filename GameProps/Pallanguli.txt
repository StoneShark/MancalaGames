<about>
Sow counter-clockwise via the multi-lap next-hole method (MLAPS of
LAPPER_NEXT). Lap sowing continues until there are no seeds in the hole
following the last seed of a lap.

If a player does not have any seeds at the start of their turn, they must pass.
Their opponent must make seeds available to them as soon as they are able.
If they can make seeds available, moves are only allowed from holes that do so.

For all but the final seed of lap, any hole sown to four seeds is captured
by the hole owner.
If the final seed of a multi-lap sow, sows a hole to four seeds, they are not captured.

After the multi-lap sowing check for captures.
The hole from which the next lap would start is empty,
capture any seeds in the hole after the empty one, that is,
the hole 'two out' or 'across the gap' from the final hole sown.

Played in rounds.

A round ends when there are 6 or fewer seeds in play (see deviation).
Round setup is via the
<a href="game_params.html#rf_ehm">Empty Hole Method</a> of
ROUND_FILL from each player's left.
After the next round setup unfilled holes are
out of play. The players alternate starting rounds.

The game is over when either player cannot fill a single hole.

Variations:

- 4 to 6 start seeds.

- No en passant capture (SOW_RULE of None).

- Change the number of holes that a round loser must be able to fill to continue playing (GOAL_PARAM).

- <nolink>Pallamguli::No_Rounds is a simpler game played with only 4 seeds per hole at the start and not played in rounds.

- <nolink>Pallamguli::Pandi - start with 5 seeds per hole and the final capture (not en passant captures) also collect the seeds opposite the capture.

- <nolink>Pallamguli::Longbeu-a-cha - series captures are added--capture as long as there is a sequence of empty hole and filled hole.

- <nolink>Pallamguli::Olinda - not played in rounds, collect more than half the seeds to win.
Start with 5 seeds per hole.
The first player chooses their sow direction; the second player sows in the opposite direction.
</about>
<deviation>
Games between inexperienced players often end in cycling seeds,
so PICKEXTRA of PICKLASTSEEDS added to make games to end rounds more reliably.
This can be reset to None via variation configuration.
