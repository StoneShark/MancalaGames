If the final seeds of a lap ends in an empty hole, the turn is over.\n\nIf the final seed of a lap makes 4 seeds in a hole on either side of the board, capture those seeds. Then, on capture, continue sowing with seeds in the next hole (after the captured hole).\n\nWhen down to the last seeds 8 seeds (at the start of a lap), seeds sown on the opponent's side are captured by the opponent. If the last seed sown would do a normal capture, the sower takes those seeds, including the last seed sown.\n\nGoal: capture more than half of the seeds.",
