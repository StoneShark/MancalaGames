A human player may choose to swap sides on either of the first two moves of the game; the AI will not swap.\n\nSow in multiple laps, counter-clockwise. Lap sowing stops for capture of 2s and 4s.  A player without a valid move must pass.\n\nCapture on 2s or 4s with final seed; capture preceeding holes in unbroken line of 2s and 4s.\n\nGoal: capture the most seeds.\n",
