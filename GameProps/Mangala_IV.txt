<about>
Start is random placement of 98 seeds.  A human player may choose to
swap sides on either of the first two moves of the game; the AI will
not swap.

Sow in multiple laps, counter-clockwise. Lap sowing stops for capture
of 2s and 4s.  A player without a valid move must pass.

Capture on 2s or 4s with final seed; capture preceeding holes in
unbroken line of 2s and 4s.

Goal: capture the most seeds.
