<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in multiple laps. Continue lapping until the
last seed falls into an empty hole or makes a hole containing 3 seeds.

If the last seed of a lap makes 3 seeds, capture those seeds and
continue the lap sowing with the seeds from the next hole. If there are
no seeds in the next hole, the turn is over.

A round ends when one player cannot move. Seeds left on the board are
allocated to the player that performed the last move.

For the next round, holes are allocated to each player based on
how many seeds they collected in the previous round.
If there is a contested hole where each player has two seeds
to fill it, a lottery is used to choose the hole owner.

The game is over when one player has complete control of 10 holes
(a lottery outcome in their favor does not win the game).

Variations:

- Motiq captures on 4s and handles round setup differently.
