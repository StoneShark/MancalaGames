<about>
Counter-clockwise, multi-lap sow. The goal is to deprive the opponent
of seeds. Moves must end in an empty hole or reach the opponent's side
of the board. Seeds are taken out of play via cross-capture.

Played in tallied rounds, the first player to win 5 rounds wins the
game. The previous round loser starts each game and their opponent is
given the board side with one seed.

Variation: ALTERNATES start pattern
</about>
<deviation>
Round tally goal is used so that the round loser can start each new game. 
In play without rounds, the starter always alternates.
