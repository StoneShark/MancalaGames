<about>
The start pattern is clipped triples.

Sow towards the center of the board, except the center hole may be
sown in either direction.

Capture on matching the number of seeds in the hole on the opposite
side of the board. Seeds from both holes are captured. Captures may be
initiated from either side of the board.

If there is an initial capture, capture up to two more holes in both
directions but each must also have a north-south matching number of
seeds. In theory, 10 holes could be captured on a single move. The
capture chain stops for each direction as soon as there are non-
matching holes.

Played in rounds. A round ends when the current player does not have
any seeds or there are 4 or fewer seeds on the board.

Goal: be the first to collect 100 total seeds.

Variations:

- count only seeds in excess of your opponents seeds (GOAL).

- different number of seeds for the win.
