That is, captures are made when the hole after the hole in which the final seed of a lap was sown, is empty and there are seeds in the hole 'two out' from the last sown seed.\nCaptures continue while holes are alternately empty and occupied in the counter-clockwise direction.\nUnlike Pallam Kuzhi, this game is not played in rounds.\n\nVariations:\n- SOW_RULE of SOW_CAPT_ALL instead of OWN_SOW_CAPT_ALL\n- See Olinda, Pallam Kuzhi, and Pandi.",
