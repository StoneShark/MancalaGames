That is, captures are made when the hole after the hole in which the final seed of a lap was sown, is empty and there are seeds in the hole 'two out' from the last sown seed.\n\nCaptures continue while holes are alternately empty and occupied in the counter-clockwise direction.\n\nVariation:\n\n- Walak-pussa played on a board with 7 holes per side and 4 seeds in each hole at the start.",
