Repeat turn if last seed is sown into the player's own store.\n\nRams are made when a hole has sufficient seeds to sow the entire opposite side of the board and cycle back on to your own side. They are marked with \u02c3. Moves may not start from these holes and they are not counted in the game tally. These holes can be captured; when captured, they are no longer rams.\n\nCross capture when seed lands in empty hole.\n\nIf you clear all of your own seeds, you capture all of your opponent's seeds that are still in play and the game ends.\n\nGoal: capture the most seeds (more than half).\n",
