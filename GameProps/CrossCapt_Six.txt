<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in single lap. Sow own store. Repeat turn if
last seed is sown into the player's own store.

Rams are made when a hole has sufficient seeds to sow the entire
opposite side of the board and cycle back on to your own side. They
are marked with ˃. Moves may not start from these holes and they are
not counted in the game tally. These holes can be captured; when
captured, they are no longer rams.

Cross capture when the final seed lands in empty hole.

The game ends under one of two conditions:

- Your opponent cannot move at the start of their turn. You collect
any seeds left on your own side of the board not in RAMs. The winner
is the player with more seeds collected.

- Either player collects more than half the seeds.
