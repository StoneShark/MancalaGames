A human player may choose to swap sides on either of the first two moves of the game; the AI will not swap.\n\nSow counter-clockwise in multiple laps.\n\nCapture when the final seed of a lap sow makes the two holes opposite each other have the same number of seeds. Capture seeds from both holes.\n\nThe game is over when one player does not have any seeds or one player has collected at least half the seeds. The seeds left on the board do not score. The winner is the player with the most seeds.",
