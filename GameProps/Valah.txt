<about>
Multilap sow in counter-clockwise direction. Sow into own store; no
other capture mechanism. If your sow ends in your own store, repeat
your turn.

A simple game to learn how multilap sowing works. The starter has a
serious advantage, use the Swap Sides (e.g. Pie Rule) if the AI is
taking too much advantage of that.
