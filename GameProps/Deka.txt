      "about": "The goal is to leave the opponent without seeds for their turn.\n\nSow counter-clockwise with multiple laps (LAPPER).\n\nAfter the first turn, holes are closed on opponent's side when the final seed of a lap brings the seeds in a hole to 3. Sowing then continues with those 3 seeds. Each player's rightmost hole may not be closed.\n\nIn subsequent sowing of closed holes (blocked), own holes are skipped but seeds for opponent's holes are taken out of play.\n\nThe <nolink>Deka board is not a 2-rank board, but hole assignment yields itself to moving the middle end holes to the respective player's right side thus making it a 2 rank board.\n\nVariations:\n- 6 to 8 holes per side\n- 2 to 4 start seeds\n- allow closing of rightmost holes (SOW_RULE of SOW_BLKD_DIV)\n",
