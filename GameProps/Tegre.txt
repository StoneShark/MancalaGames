If that hole is on your opponent's side of the board\n   2. If that hole is on your side of the board and the opponent's hole opposite is empty\n\nIf there are seeds opposite that hole, capture them and then continue the lap sowing with the single seed. Instead of simply stopping multi-lap sowing for captures as many other multi-lap games, capturing continues the multi-lap sowing. \n\nA round ends when one player cannot move. Seeds left on the board are allocated to the player that performed the last move. To setup for the next round, each player fills as many holes on their side of the board as they can with 4 seeds each and any leftover seeds are put into their store. The unoccupied holes are available for play during the round.\n\nThe game ends when one player cannot fill 4 holes.",
