<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in multiple laps. Continue lapping until the
last seed falls into an empty hole.

The turn ends if:

   1. If that hole is on your opponent's side of the board

   2. If that hole is on your side of the board and the opponent's
hole opposite is empty

If there are seeds opposite that hole, capture them and then continue
the lap sowing with the single seed. Instead of simply stopping multi-
lap sowing for captures as many other multi-lap games, capturing
continues the multi-lap sowing.

A round ends when one player cannot move. Seeds left on the board are
allocated to the player that performed the last move. To setup for the
next round, each player fills as many holes on their side of the board
as they can with 4 seeds each and any leftover seeds are put into
their store. The unoccupied holes are available for play during the
round.

The game ends when one player cannot fill 4 holes.
