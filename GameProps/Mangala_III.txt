<about>
Split sow from any of your holes with 2 or more seeds.
Capture on 2s and 4s on either side of the board.

The game ends when one player has sufficient seeds for the win
or the current player does not have a valid move.

When the game ends, seeds still in play go to the hole owner.

Goal: collect the more than half the total seeds.

Variations:

- Sow in multiple laps (MLAPS).

- Multiple capture (MULTICAPT of -1).

- Repeat turn on capture (CAPT_RTURN).

- When capturing, take any seeds across the board from captured holes
(PICKEXTRA of PICKCROSSMULT).
</about>
<deviation>
The introduction to the game states that the game ends whenever either player
has zero or one seed in each hole, but paragraph at the end of the rules the
game only ends when the current player does not have a valid move.
The first condition is not implemented (Mancala Games does not support it).
