<about>
A territory game that uses both stores and wegs (children).

Sow is multi-lap, counter-clockwise. The opening move is prescribed:
Plus1Minus1; the starting player selects which hole the pattern starts
from.

Wegs are made when a final seed sows a hole to 4 seeds on your
opponent's territory.

Captures are on the final seed being sown into an opponent's weg. The
sown seed and one more (if there is one) are captured to your store.
Repeat turn on capture.

Owners of holes are determined after each round based on the number of
seeds captured. Win the game by owning 10 holes.

Variations:

- adjust the number of holes needed for a win.
