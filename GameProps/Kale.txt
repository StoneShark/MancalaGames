The first capture must be on the opponent's side of the board, but a multi-capture chain may continue onto your own side of the board. A grand slam does not capture--the seeds are left on the  board.\n\nThe game ends when seeds cannot be shared with a player without seeds. The remaining seeds on the board go that the player (the unfed one). Games caught in cycles can be ended by the menu command End Round.\n\nGoal: capture at least half of the seeds.\n",
