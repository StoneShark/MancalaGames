<about>
Sow multilap next hole counter-clockwise.

Capture two out (or across the gap) from the final seed sown. Multiple
captures are done as long as there is an empty hole-filled hole
pattern.

Played in rounds. A round ends when there are no moves. Use the End
Round command if seeds are cycling--though seeds go to hole owners.

The game is won when the loser cannot fill two holes.
