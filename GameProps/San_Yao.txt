<about>
Sow multilap next hole counter-clockwise.

Capture two out (or across the gap) from the final seed sown. Multiple
captures are done as long as there is an empty hole-filled hole
pattern.

Played in rounds. A round ends when there are no moves. Use the End
Round command if seeds are cycling--though seeds go to hole owners.

When setting up for each new round the winner fills the holes that
they can with 5 seeds each. Any extra seeds are given to the round
loser. Player's control the holes they fill in the next round.
The winner starts the new round.

The game ends when the winner controls 9 holes.
