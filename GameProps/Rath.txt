      "about": "At the start of play, each player has one child--a rath--in their rightmost hole. Additional children may not be created.\n\nSow counter-clockwise in multiple laps. Turns may not start from your rath and must start with at least 2 seeds. If a player does not have a valid move on their turn, they must pass until they do have a valid move.\n\nSow into your own rath, but not your opponent's unless it is the final seed of the sow. If the final seed of a sow ends in your opponents rath, move that seed plus one more (if there is one) to your own rath. No other capture mechanism is provided.\n\nGoal: collect more than half of the seeds in your own rath.\n\nVariation:\n\n- played on boards from 7 to 13 holes per side.\n",
