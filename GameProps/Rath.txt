<about>
At the start of play, each player has one child--a rath--in their
rightmost hole. Additional children may not be created.

Sow counter-clockwise in multiple laps. Turns may not start from your
rath and must start with at least 2 seeds. If a player does not have a
valid move on their turn, they must pass until they do have a valid
move.

Sow into your own rath, but not your opponent's unless it is the final
seed of the sow. If the final seed of a sow ends in your opponents
rath, move that seed plus one more (if there is one) to your own rath.
No other capture mechanism is provided.

Goal: collect more than half of the seeds in your own rath.

Variation:

- played on boards from 7 to 13 holes per side.
