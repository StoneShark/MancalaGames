<about>
The first move by each player is sown counter-clockwise, the player
chooses the sow direction for subsequent moves.

Sow in multiple laps until the final seed of a laps ends in an empty hole
or makes 4 seeds.

Captures are on 4s on the final seed sown, regardless of hole owner.
If this capture leaves only 4 seeds in play, they are also taken.

If your opponent does not have seeds you must share. If you cannot
share, your opponent claims your remaining seeds and the game ends.

Goal: collect the most seeds.
