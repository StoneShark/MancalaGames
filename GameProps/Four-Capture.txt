<about>
The first move by each player is sown counter-clockwise, the player
chooses the sow direction for subsequent moves.

Sow in multiple laps until the final seed of a laps ends in an empty hole
or makes 4 seeds on your own side of the board (capture those seeds).

Any holes on your own side of the board that are sown to 4 are moved to your store.

If the final seed of a lap sows an opponent's hole to 4 seeds those seeds are
picked up and the multiplap sowing continues.

If your opponent does not have seeds you must share. If you cannot
share your opponent claims your remaining seeds and the game ends.

Goal: collect the most seeds.
