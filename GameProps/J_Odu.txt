<about>
Multi-lap clockwise sow.

If a player does not have any seeds at the start of their turn,
they must pass. Their opponent must make seeds available to them
as soon as they are able. If they can make seeds available,
moves are only allowed from holes that do so.

Cross captures when the final seed of a sow end's in your own empty hole
and the opposite hole has 1 or 2 seeds.
Continue the capture chain as long as the opposite holes contain 1 or 2 seeds,
but a grand slam capture leaves the seeds in the last hole (rightmost).
When only one hole has seeds, the capture is performed.

Games end when there are two or fewer seeds on the board.
Other games with cycling seeds may be ended with the End Game menu command.
In either case, seeds on the board go to the hole owners.

Goal: collect more than half the seeds.

Variation:

- J_Odu::Rounds - played in rounds.
Seeds are captured from your opponent's holes.
The loser of the previous round starts each new round.
Each round is played until there are two or fewer seeds on the board or
the round is ended with End Round menu command.
The goal parameter (Config Variant...) defines the number of holes the
winner must control to win the game.
</about>
<deviation 1>
Games are ended when there are only one or two seeds on the board.
These are generally but not always cycling seeds; this may be
turned off via the Config Variant... menu command.
</deviation 1>
<deviation 2>
The rounds variant does not setup exactly as described.
All holes are always filled with seeds.
The rules state that any seeds left after filling holes to
fours should be left in the players' stores and that
the empty hole should go to the round loser.
