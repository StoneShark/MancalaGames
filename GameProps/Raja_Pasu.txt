<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in lapper next fashion. Hole owners capture all
holes sown to 4 seeds.

When the lap sowing ends, capture any seeds across the gap from the
empty hole that stopped the lap sowing.

Played in rounds. A round ends when one player does not have any moves.
Unclaimed seeds go to the hole owners (that is the player with seeds, gets
them). The player with the most seeds is the winner of the round.

Setup for each round involves filling as many holes as a player can
with 7 seeds. Extra seeds are placed in the player's store. Any empty
holes are out of play for the round (blocked). The winner of the
previous round, starts the new round.

The game ends when one player cannot fill a single hole with 7 seeds.
