<about>
A deprive game.

Sow direction is single-lap CCW. Moves are permitted only from holes
that reach the opponent's side of the board or end in an empty hole on
your own side.

If the last seed of a sow ends in an empty hole, remove the seeds
across the board from it (cross capture).  Leave the seed effecting
the removal. Seeds may be removed from either side of the board.
Careful play is needed, or you'll eliminate your own seeds.
