<about>
A deprive game with separate north & south cycles.

Sow only on your own side of the board in multiple laps. If the final
seed of a lap falls into an empty hole and there are seeds across from
it, gather those and the final sown seed and continue sowing.

<nolink>mikro tsoro often gets caught in endless sowing (more than 75
laps on a single turn), which ends the game in a TIE. The Game menu
option Disallow Endless Sows can be used to prevent such moves (set by
default for this game in the mancala.ini file).

Goal: move all of your opponents seeds to your side of the board.

mikro tsoro was invented by the Austrian Matthias Liszt in August
2007.

Variation:

- odd board sizes 5 to 15

- 2 to 8 start seeds
