      "about": "A deprive game with separate north & south cycles.\n\nSow only on your own side of the board in multiple laps. If the final seed of a lap falls into an empty hole and there are seeds across from it, gather those and the final sown seed and continue sowing.\n\n<nolink>mikro tsoro often gets caught in endless sowing (more than 75 laps on a single turn), which ends the game in a TIE. The Game menu option Disallow Endless Sows can be used to prevent such moves (set by default for this game in the mancala.ini file). \n\nGoal: move all of your opponents seeds to your side of the board. \n\nmikro tsoro was invented by the Austrian Matthias Liszt in August 2007.\n\nVariation:\n\n- odd board sizes 5 to 15\n",
