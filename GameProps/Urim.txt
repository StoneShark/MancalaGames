Holes may never be sown above 17 seeds; skip such holes while sowing. If your opponent has no seeds, you must make seeds available to them (if you can).\nIf a grand slam were to occur, the seeds are left on the board, that is, they are not captured.\nA round ends when the current player cannot move or when the outcome cannot change. The game ends when one player scores 10 points: 1 point for each win and another point for a skunk, i.e. collecting 36 or more seeds for the win.\n",
