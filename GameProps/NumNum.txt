Owners of holes are updated at the start of each round based on the number of seeds captured in the previous round.\nCaptures are on 4s on the final sown seed by the sower (regardless of hole owner). The seeds of any hole sown to 4 are captured by the hole's owner (regardless of sower).\nA player must pass, if they have no moves. If neither player has moves, the game is over.\n\nVariations: don't allow pass, change number of holes required for win.",
