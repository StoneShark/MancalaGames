      "about": "A multi-lap mancala played in rounds. The goal is to claim ownership of at least 10 holes. Each player initially owns the holes on their side of the board. Owners of holes are updated at the start of each round based on the number of seeds captured in the previous round.\n\nCaptures are on 4s on the final sown seed by the sower (regardless of hole owner). The seeds of any hole sown to 4 are captured by the hole's owner (regardless of sower).\n\nA player must pass, if they have no moves. If neither player has moves, the game is over.\n\nVariations:\n- don't allow pass\n- change number of holes required for win\n- prescribed opening PLUS1MINUS1\n- repeat turn on capture\n- common board sizes: 6, 7 or 12\n- only sower captures during sowing (SOW_RULE: SOW_SOW_CAPT_ALL)\n- see Lam Waladach",
