<about>
User chooses sow direction for the middle and end holes; the other
holes sow towards the closest edge of the board (split sow).

Each player may only make one child by sowing one of their own,
interior holes to 4 seeds. Children cannot be created in either end
hole.

Cross capture on opponents side of the board but only if 4 or fewer
seeds and not until you have a child to move the seeds into.

The game ends when either cannot move. Seeds remaining in play do not
score.

Goal: collect more than half the seeds.

Variations:

- sow towards center instead of split which sows toward the outside
edges

- allowable child locations

- which holes the player may select the sow direction

- capture limit
