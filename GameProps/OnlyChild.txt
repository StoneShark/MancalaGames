Children cannot be created in either end hole.\n\nCross capture on opponents side of the board but only if 4 or fewer seeds and not until you have a child to move the seeds into.\n\nThe game ends when either cannot move. Seeds remaining in play do not score.\n\nGoal: collect more than half the seeds.\n\nVariations:\n\n- sow towards center instead of split which sows toward the outside edges\n\n- allowable child locations\n\n- which holes the player may select the sow direction\n\n- capture limit",
