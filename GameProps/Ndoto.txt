<about>
Sow multi-lap and counter-clockwise. Single seed sow may not start
multilaps, that is, a single seeds may only be moved to empty holes.

Cross capture when single seeds ends in own hole, capture seeds from
across the board. Leave the seed effecting the capture on your side of
the board.

The game ends when one player has more than half the seeds or when the
current player cannot move.

Goal: collect the most seeds.

Variations:

- Minimum move of 2, unless all occupied holes have single seeds
without a limit on where single seeds can be moved (ALLOW_RULE:
SINGLE_ONLY_ALL).

- <nolink>Ndoto::Bao - Minimum move of 2, unless all occupied holes have single seeds which
may only be moved to empty holes (ALLOW_RULE: SINGLE_ALL_TO_ZERO).

- board size choice included to make game easier.
