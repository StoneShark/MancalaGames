This is accomplished by using the unlock mechanism, moving from a hole unlocks it. Until all of a players holes are unlocked, moves may only start from locked holes.\nIf a player does not have a move, they must pass.\nCaptures are made when the hole after the final seed sown contains 1, 3 or 5 seeds. Those seeds (in the next hole) are captured, but not any from the final hole sown. These captures do not check the lock status.\nThe game ends when one player has accumulated more than half of the seeds or when neither player can move.",
