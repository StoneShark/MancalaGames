If there is a capture, another user input is accepted to identify where the capture seeds should be put. The indicator for this is subtle: your store will still show your turn and your opponent's holes will be highlighted for input and shown in your color.\n\nThe game is played in tallied rounds. Win a round by clearing your own side of the board. Win the game with 3 round wins (best of 5).\n",
