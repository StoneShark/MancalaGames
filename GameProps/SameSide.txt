If there is a capture, another user input is accepted to identify where the capture seeds should be put. The indicator for this is subtle: your store will still show your turn and you opponents holes will be highlighted for input.\n\nThe AI delay occurs between these two moves when it is the AI turn's; wait for the AI to finish the turn before starting your turn.\n\nIn this game, the number of captured seeds will always be even.\n\nGoal: clear your own side of the board.",
