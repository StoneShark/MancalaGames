<about>
Sow counter-clockwise but only on your own side of the board.

Multiple capture on evens but place captured seeds in opponent's hole
of your choice.

A move has the typical draw, sow and check capture phases. If there is
a capture (but not a win), 
another user input is accepted to identify where the
capture seeds should be put.

The game is played in tallied rounds. Win a round by clearing your own
side of the board. Win the game with 3 round wins (best of 5).
