<about>
Sow in multi-laps, counter-clockwise. Capture on 4s from an opponent's
hole.

Played in rounds. A round ends when there are 8 or fewer seeds on the
board. These unclaimed seeds go to the hole owners. Holes are
allocated based on seed counts. Territory end game round rules are
applied. The winner may choose which of the loser's holes they wish to
own.

The game ends when one player has control of 10 holes. A territory
game.

<nolink>Adji Kui II is not exactly fair--North has a very slight advantage.
<nolink>Adji Kui II ends when there are 8 seeds left on the board,
the selection of UNCLAIMED describes who gets those seeds.
None of the three allowable options are fair:
HOLE_OWNER (game definition), LAST_MOVER, or DIVVIED.

The game can be made fair by using PICKEXTRA of PICK2XLASTSEEDS--the
round starter gets the last 8 seeds.
This does provide the non-starter of the overall game an advantage;
whereas in the base game the starter/non-starter evaluates fair.
This is the ending Ba-awa uses, a very similar game.
