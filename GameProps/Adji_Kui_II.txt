<about>
Sow in multi-laps, counter-clockwise. Capture on 4s from an opponent's
hole.

Played in rounds. A round ends when there are 8 or fewer seeds on the
board. These unclaimed seeds go to the hole owners. Holes are
allocated based on seed counts. Territory end game round rules are
applied. The winner may choose which of the loser's holes they wish to
own.

The game ends when one player has control of 10 holes. A territory
game.

<nolink>Adji_Kui_II does suffer from "endless" multi-lap sows (one multi-lap sow of than 75 laps).
When an endless sow is detected; the game is ended with QUITTER configuration.
The quitter is configured as hole owner to maintain game fairness.

Moves that would result in endless sows can be disallowed with the run-time menu option:
Game -> Disallow Endless Sows.
