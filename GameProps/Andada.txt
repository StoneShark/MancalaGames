Sow counter-clockwise in multiple laps.\n\nWhen final the seed of a sow ends in an empty hole on your own side of board, any opposite seeds are removed from play (cross capture).\n\nWhen all holes are singletons or empty, sowing changes to a bear off method, that is, all seeds reaching the end of the board are removed from play. Once this method is activated in a game, sowing does not return to normal.\n\nWinner: the last player with one seed on the board (a deprive game).\n\nVariation:\n- board size any multiple of 3 (often a very large board)\n- sow clockwise\n",
