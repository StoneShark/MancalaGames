      "about": "A multi-lap mancala played in rounds. The goal is to claim ownership of at least 10 holes. Each player initially owns the holes on their side of the board. Owners of holes are updated at the start of each round based on the number of seeds captured in the previous round.\n\nCaptures are on 4s on the final sown seed by the sower (regardless of hole owner). The seeds of any hole sown to 4 are captured by the hole's owner (regardless of sower).\n\nA player must pass if they have no moves. If neither player has moves, the game is over.\n\nVariations:\n- common board sizes: 6, 7 or 12\n- change number of holes required for win (GOAL_PARAM)\n- don't allow passing (MUSTPASS)\n- PRESCRIBED opening PLUS1MINUS1\n- repeat turn on capture (CAPT_RTURN)\n- only sower captures during sowing (SOW_RULE: SOW_CAPT_ALL)\n- when 8 seeds or fewer, the round starter takes them (PICKEXTRA: PICK2NLASTSEEDS)\n- see Lam Waladach\n",
