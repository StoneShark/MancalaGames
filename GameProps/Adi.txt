<about>
A multi-lap mancala played in rounds. The goal is to claim ownership
of at least 10 holes. Each player initially owns the holes on their
side of the board. Owners of holes are updated at the start of each
round based on the number of seeds captured in the previous round.

Captures are on 4s on the final sown seed by the sower (regardless of
hole owner). The seeds of any hole sown to 4 are captured by the
hole's owner (regardless of sower).

A player must pass if they have no moves. If neither player has moves,
the game is over.

Variations:

- Common board sizes: 6, 7 or 12.

- Change number of holes required for win (GOAL_PARAM).

- Don't allow passing (MUSTPASS off).

- PRESCRIBED opening PLUS1MINUS1.

- Repeat turn on capture (CAPT_RTURN).

- Any en passant capture (SOW_RULE) or no en passant captures.

- When 8 seeds or fewer, the round starter takes them (PICKEXTRA:
PICK2NLASTSEEDS).

- Don't use round fill (ROUND_FILL) of Winner Chooses Owners (UCHOWN),
see NumNum.

- <nolink>Adi::No_Rounds - not played in rounds; the games ends as soon as
one player has half the seeds.
