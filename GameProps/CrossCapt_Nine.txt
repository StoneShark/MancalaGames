<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in single lap. 

Sow both stores:

- If last seed is sown into the player's own store, take a repeat turn.

- If last seed is sown into the opponent's store, capture the seeds in their store.

Cross capture when seed lands in empty hole on your side of the board. 

If you clear all of your own seeds, you capture all of your opponent's
seeds that are still in play and the game ends.

Goal: capture the most seeds (more than half).
