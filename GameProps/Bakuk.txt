<about>
Single lap mancala, sow counter-clockwise.

Capture on 2s and 4s. Do multiple captures of immediately preceding
holes also with 2 or 4 seeds (multiple capture stops before hole not
with 2 or 4 seeds).

The game ends when the current player does not have a move.
Seeds left on the board are not scored.

Goal: capture more than half of the seeds.

Variation:

- board size 3 to 6 holes per side.

- leave one seed in the start hole.

- capture on 2s, 4s and 6s.

- players must pass if they do not have a move.
The game ends when one player has sufficient seeds to win or neither player has a move.

- capture in sow direction--following holes, instead of preceeding
holes.

- <nolink>Bakuk::Koumma - captures on 2s, 4s, and 6s and leave one seed in the start hole.
</about>
<note>
The rules as Valdez describes them contradict in that players must pass if they do not have a move,
but the game ends when one player does not have a move at the start of their turn.
Passes are not required.
