Owners of holes are updated at the start of each round based on the number of seeds captured in the previous round.\n\nCaptures are on 4s on the final sown seed by the sower (regardless of hole owner). Captures are disallowed on the first move of the game. The seeds of any hole sown to 4 are captured by the hole's owner (regardless of sower) after the first move.\n\nA player must pass, if they have no moves. If neither player has moves, the game is over.",
