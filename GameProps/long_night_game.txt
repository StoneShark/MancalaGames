<about>
Sow in multiple laps counter-clocks. Moves may only start from holes
that reach an occupied hole on the first lap.

A player must pass if they do not have a move.

After sowing, capture all singletons.

The game ends when there are no legal moves. Seeds left on the board
are not counted.

Goal: capture the most seeds.

long night game was invented by the Austrian Matthias Liszt in August
2006.
