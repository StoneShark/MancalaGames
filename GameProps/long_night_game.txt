<about>
Fourty seeds are randomly placed on the board at the start of play;
each hole will contain at least two seeds.

Sow in multiple laps counter-clockwise.
Moves may only start from holes that reach an occupied hole
on the first lap.

A player must pass if they do not have a move.

After sowing, capture all singletons anywhere on the board.

A round ends when one player has more than half the seeds
or there are no legal moves.
Seeds left on the board are not counted.

Played in tallied rounds--all rounds are setup the same way;
win 3 to win the game.
The starter alternates.


<nolink>long night game was invented by the Austrian Matthias Liszt in August
