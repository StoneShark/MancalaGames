<about>
A multi-lap mancala played in rounds. The goal is to claim ownership
of at least 9 holes. Each player initially owns the holes on their
side of the board. Owners of holes are updated at the start of each
round based on the number of seeds captured in the previous round.

Sow direction is counter-clockwise. There are no captures or en passant
captures on the first turn.

The seeds of any hole sown (except the last seed of a lap) to 4 are
captured by the hole's owner (regardless of sower).

Captures are on 4s on the final sown seed by
the sower (regardless of hole owner). A capture results in  a repeat
turn. Captures and pick 4s are allowed on the first move of the game.

A player must pass if they have no moves.

If neither player has moves, the game is over. The game also ends if
there are fewer than 6 seeds in play, with the seeds going to the
round starter.

Variations:

- change the number of holes required for the win.

- turn off repeat turn on capture.
