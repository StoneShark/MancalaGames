<about>
A single-lap mancala, sow direction is determined by the number of
seeds in the hole.  Even seeds are sown clockwise. Odd seeds are sown
counter-clockwise. A sow which cycles the board, will skip the hole
that the move started from. If your opponent has no seeds, you must
make seeds available to them (if you can).

Captures are on 2s and 3s from the opponent's side (final seed sown
makes either 2 or 3).  As long as there is a an unbroken group of
holes containing 2 or 3 seeds immediately preceding the final hole
sown, these holes are also captured.
