<about>
Single-lap, clockwise-sow Mancala in which all holes are playable by
both players.

If a sow ends in an occupied hole and the next hole is empty, capture
the seeds in the following hole.

Goal: collect the most seeds.

Variations:

- Prevent captures on the first one or two moves.

- Skip the start hole which causes every sow to leave an open hole.
