If capture, pick any seeds across the board from the capture and move again (repeat turn). Only one repeat turn is allowed, even if there is a second capture a second repeat turn is not allowed.\n\nPlayed in rounds. Each round ends when there are no moves for either player. Any holes that the loser cannot fill with 5 seeds are out of play for the round. The round starter alternates. Unclaimed seeds at the end of a round are collected by the hole owner.\n\nThe game ends when one player cannot fill one hole for a new round.\n",
