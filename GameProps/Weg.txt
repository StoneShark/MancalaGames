Wegs are made when a final seed sows a hole to 4 seeds in your opponent's territory. Captures are on the final seed being sown into an opponent's weg. The sown seed and one more (if there is one) are captured to your store. Repeat turn on capture (but not after making a weg). Played in rounds with start player alternating.\n\nVariations:\n- 2x6 with 3 start seeds\n- 2x10 with 4 start seeds\n- not played in rounds\n- no repeat turn on capture",
