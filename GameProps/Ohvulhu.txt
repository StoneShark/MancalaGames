<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in multiple laps including ones own store.
Repeat turn when sow ends in own store.

Cross capture on final seed sown to own side of the board.

Played in rounds. A round ends a player does not have a move on their
turn.

Setup for a new round uses the
<a href="game_params.html#rf_ehm">Empty Hole Method</a>
with blocks, leaving unfilled holes out of play for the next round.
The round starter alternates.

The game is over when one player cannot control at least 4 holes
at the start of a round.

Variations:

- simultaneous opening move (not supported by Mancala Games).

- clockwise sow direction.

- 6, 7, 8 or 10 holes per side with the number of start seeds
equalling the number of holes per side (<nolink>Ohvulhu::Ohvulhu_n
where n is holes and start seeds).

- Dakon requires that you pass when you do not have a move (MUSTPASS).
