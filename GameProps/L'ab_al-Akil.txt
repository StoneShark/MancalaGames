      "about": "Initial position is 72 seeds placed randomly. A human player may choose to swap sides on either of the first two moves of the game; the AI will not swap.\n\nSow is counter-clockwise in multiple-laps. Multilap sowing ends when the final seed ends in an empty hole or for capturing. If your opponent does not have any seeds you must share seeds if you can.\n\nMultiple captures on 2s and 4s from either row. For each hole captured, take any seeds from the hole across the board.\n\nPlayed in rounds. A round ends either when the outcome cannot change or when there are cycling seeds on the board (use the menu command End Round).\n\nThe game ends when one player has accumulated a sum of 60 seeds more than their opponent in a series of games.  Each game a player is award a number of seeds (winner seeds - loser seeds), this sum must exceed 60 for the win.\n\nVariation: L'ab Ghashim uses an all equal initial setup.\n",
