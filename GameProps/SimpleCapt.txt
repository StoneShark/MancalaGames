<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in single lap. Sow own store. Repeat turn if
last seed is sown into the player's own store.

If you clear all of your own seeds, you capture all of your opponent's
seeds that are still in play and the game ends.

Goal: capture the most seeds.

Variations:

- <nolink>SimpleCapt::Anywhere - Allow moves from any holes on the
board. Don't end the game until one player has won or there is a tie.

- <nolink>SimpleCapt::LastCapt - capture the last seed sown
when it ends in an empty hole on your own
side of the board (CAPT_MAX of 1 and CAPT_SIDE of OWN).

- SimpleCapt_PCapt is a multilap sow variant where your opponent may
passively capture the contents of your store when your final seed of a sow
ends on their side in an empty hole!

- sow in multiple-laps (SOW_DIRECT of LAPPER) possibly limiting lap
continueing to one side of the board.
