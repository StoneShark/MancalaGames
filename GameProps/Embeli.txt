      "about": "The goal is to immobilize your opponent, that is, reduce them to only singletons or no seeds at all.\n\nSow counter-clockwise with multiple laps (LAPPER). Singletons cannot be moved.\n\nHoles are closed on opponent's side when the final seed of a lap brings the seeds in a hole to 4. Sowing then continues with those 4 seeds. Each player's rightmost hole may not be closed (their nti).\n\nIn subsequent sowing of closed holes (blocked), own holes are skipped but seeds for opponent's holes are taken out of play.\n\nThe <nolink>Embeli board is not a 2-rank board, but hole assignment yields itself to moving the middle end holes (nti) to the respective player's right side thus making it a 2 rank board.\n",
