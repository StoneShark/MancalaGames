<about>
The goal is to immobilize your opponent, that is, reduce them to only
singletons or no seeds at all.

Sow counter-clockwise with multiple laps (LAPPER). Singletons cannot
be moved.

Holes are closed on opponent's side when the final seed of a lap
brings the seeds in a hole to 4. Sowing then continues with those 4
seeds. Each player's rightmost hole may not be closed (their nti).

In subsequent sowing of closed holes (blocked), own holes are skipped
but seeds for opponent's holes are taken out of play.

The <nolink>Embeli board is not a 2-rank board, but hole assignment
yields itself to moving the middle end holes (nti) to the respective
player's right side thus making it a 2 rank board.
