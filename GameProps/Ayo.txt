<Note>
A round outcome can be changed when the final two seeds are in the
next player's rightmost hole and the hole across from it
and when the seeds collected by each player are with in 2 of eachother.
The likelyhood of this is about 1 in 3000.
A final capture is possible, changing the round outcome.
</Note>
<about>
Multi-lap clockwise sow.

If a player does not have any seeds at the start of their turn,
they must pass. Their opponent must make seeds available to them
as soon as they are able. If they can make seeds available,
moves are only allowed from holes that do so.

Multiple captures on 2s & 3s from opponent's holes,
but a grand slam capture leaves the seeds in the last hole (mover's rightmost).
When only one hole has seeds, the capture is performed.

<nolink>Ayo is a territory game played in rounds.
A round ends when there are one or two seeds on the board.
If there are more than 2 seeds cycling the board,
the game can be ended and scored with the End Round menu command.
In either case, seeds on the board go to the hole owners.

Round setup is based on the number of seeds collected.
Each player fills the holes that can with 4 seeds,
extra seeds are put into their stores.
This might result in one empty hole
that the round loser will control.

The round loser starts each new round.

Goal: control 9 holes.

Variation:

- holes required to win the game (GOAL_PARAM).

- don't end the game when one or two seeds (END_COND). See Note.

- <nolink>Ayo::No_Rounds - not played in rounds.
Goal is to collect more seeds than opponent.

- <a href="#J'Odu">J'Odu</a> uses the same rules but is a
cross capture game with the ONE_ANY capture pattern.
