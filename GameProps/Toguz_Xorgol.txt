<about>
A single-lap, clockwise-sow mancala. One seed is left in the start
hole when sowing; unless there is only one seed, then it is moved'
forward one hole.

Capture on evens that are greater than or equal to 4.

If the final seed of a sow brings a hole to three seeds, a tuzdek is
made (child). A tuzdek cannot be made on rightmost hole on the
opponent's side--this would be the last hole before sowing would
continue back to your own side of the board. Tuzdeks cannot be
directly opposite eachother.

Variation:

- Toguz Kumalak is very similar.
