One seed is left in the start hole when sowing; unless there is only one seed, then it is moved' forward one hole.\n\nCapture on evens that are greater than or equal to 4.\n\nIf the final seed of a sow brings a hole to three seeds, a tuzdek is made (child). A tuzdek cannot be made on rightmost hole on the opponent's side--this would be the last hole before sowing would continue back to your own side of the board. Tuzdeks cannot be directly opposite eachother.\n\nVariation:\n- Toguz Kumalak is very similar.\n",
