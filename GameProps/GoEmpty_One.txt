<about>
Sow counter-clockwise in multiple laps lap. Sow own store. Repeat turn
if last seed is sown into the player's own store. The number of seeds
collected in stores does not matter (so they are not shown).

Goal: If you clear all of your own seeds you win.

Variations:

- GoEmpty_Two: Start seeds are 3 (not 4). Sow both stores; repeat turn
if last seed ends in either store. The user may choose the sow
direction for each move.
