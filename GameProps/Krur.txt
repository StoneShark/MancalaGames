The only capture mechanism is to collect seeds in your own children.\n\nGoal: collect at least half the seeds in your own children.\n\nVariants:\n- played in rounds with blocks\n- played in rounds and loser puts last 1-3 seeds into occupied holes but must result in an even number of seeds, thus one extra seed might not be placed (not supported by Mancala Games; Mancala World)\n",
