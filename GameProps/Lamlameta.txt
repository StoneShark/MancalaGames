<about>
Counter-clockwise sow, multi-lap sow. The first move must be from
player's rightmost two holes. Subsequent moves may only be played from
holes:

- that do not contain 2 seeds,

- unless all of the player's holes contain 2, then any hole maybe
played.

When sowing, skip opponent's holes with two seeds (except first move).

No capture on game opening move. Cross-capture from opponent's side of
board but only if it contains 2 seeds; on capture pick all of
opponents holes with 2 seeds.

Played in Rounds. Each round ends when the current player has no
moves. The game ends when one player can fill 4 holes at the start of
the round (change with GOAL_PARAM).
