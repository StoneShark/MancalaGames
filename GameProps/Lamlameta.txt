Subsequent moves may only be played from holes:\n\n- that do not contain 2 seeds,\n\n- unless all of the player's holes contain 2, then any hole maybe played.\n\nWhen sowing, skip opponent's holes with two seeds (except first move).\n\nNo capture on game opening move. Cross-capture from opponent's side of board but only if it contains 2 seeds; on capture pick all of opponents holes with 2 seeds.\n\nPlayed in Rounds. Each round ends when the current player has no moves. The game ends when one player can fill 4 holes at the start of the round (change with GOAL_PARAM).",
