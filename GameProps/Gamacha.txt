<about>
Counter-clockwise, multi-lap sow. Moves must end in an empty hole or
reach opponent's side of the board.

Seeds are taken out of play via cross-capture.

The goal is to deprive the opponent of seeds.

Variations:

- Sadeqa: smaller board, played in rounds for best of 9 games, uses
ALTS_WITH_1 start pattern.

- suggested start patterns: ALTERNATES, ALTS_WITH_1, CLIPPEDTRIPPLES
or ALTS_SPLIT (GAMACHA is configured in base game).

- any allow rule except MOVE_ALL_HOLES_FIRST.

- vary the number of holes and start seeds
