<about>
Multilap sow, create wegs on 4s.

No additional capture mechanism is included.

Goal: collect the most seeds.

Variations:

- Don't include stores.  This only has an impact with weg children, in
that you cannot capture from your opponent's children until you have
your own.

- Multipla or single lap

- Any child type

- Any child rules that do not require a territory goal

- Any child locations that are not fixed
