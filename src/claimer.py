"""Define the claimers, takers and divviers used by the enders.

Claimers can always use the stores:

    1. If the game is configured without stores but with children
       then ChildNoStoresEnder, will move the seeds back to
       the board.

    2. If it's a clear or deprive game (no stores and no children),
       claimers are not used in the enders.

    3. Other games without stores or children are dumb.


Naming convensions:

    Claim_*:    don't move any seeds, but count them
    Take_*:     move/remove unclaimed seeds, but don't move child seeds
    Divvy_*:    the game is over, do something fair with unclaimed seeds
