If a player has no moves at the start of their turn, then the game outcome is determined by who has seeds: If both players have seeds, the game ends in a tie. If the current player has seeds, but the previous player does not, then the current player wins because they forced the previous player to give away all their seeds.

Several round fill mechanisms use the same general approach called the Empty Hole Method. The loser of the previous round will end up with empty holes. These holes are not playable if BLOCKS are used; otherwise they are playable. This method is not used for RND_* GOAL games.
The seeds each player accummulated in the previous round are distributed into holes with exactly the same number in each. That number of seeds is NBR_START.

The loser will fill as many holes as they can with nbr_start seeds and put any remaining seeds (fewer than nbr_start) into their own store.
LEFT_FILE, RIGHT_FILL and OUTSIDE_FILL define which holes that the loser must fill. UCHOOSE allows the loser to choose which holes have seeds.

- OUTSIDE_FILL: fill the round loser's holes from the outside ends toward the middle with nbr_start seeds each. Leftmost, rightmost, 2nd leftmost, 2nd rightmost, etc. until the seeds are used up.
- EVEN_FILL: fill all holes (both sides) with the same number of seeds; determined by dividing the losers seeds by the number of holes per side. If that is not playable based on the minimum number of seeds required for a move (MIN_MOVE); extra seeds are put in each players leftmost hole. Any extra seeds are put in each player's store.
- SHORTEN: the number of holes that the round loser can fill with NBR_START seeds are fill on both sides, other holes are left empty. Holes are filled opposite eachother. If BLOCKS is selected, the board is shortened to the number of holes filled (empty holes are blocked and out of play). If the game uses children, they will not be created if the board size is reduced to 3 or less.
- UCHOOSE: allow user to choose which holes have seeds (are not blocked) when ROUNDS and BLOCKS are used.
- UMOVE: allow the loser to choose where seeds are placed. At least one seed must be placed in each hole and the game must be playable (at least one hole has MIN_MOVE seeds), remaining seeds are placed in the store. The winner's layout is the same layout but reflected.

- OFF: Single lap sowing. Seeds from the start hole are sown, typically, one per hole until expened.
- LAPPER:  If the first sow ends in a hole with more than one seed, pickup all the seeds and continue sowing another ""lap"". Note that lap here does not mean a full cicuit of the board, only an individual sow operation. In general, sowing laps continues in this manner until the final seed of a lap reaches an empty hole. There are games with other conditions for ending a multilap low such as making a capture or making a child. 
  + Several values of SOW_RULE perform an operation after each lap sown: SOW_CLKD_DIV(_NR) closes the final hole and CHANGE_DIR_LAP changes the direction of sowing after each lap.
- LAPPER_NEXT:  For lapper_next sowing, the number of seeds in the last sown hole of lap do not matter. Instead, if the hole after the last sown hole has any seeds, those seeds are used to continue sowing the next lap. Sowing continues until the hole after the lap's final seed is empty. There are games with other conditions for ending a multilap low such as making a capture or making a child.

- CW: clockwise
- SPLIT: left side holes sow counter-clockwise and right side holes sow clockwise, an odd middle hole must be set in UDIR_HOLES.
- CCW: counter-clockwise
- PLAYALTDIR: on the first move of the game, the first player chooses their sow direction using the UDIR_HOLES method (by mouse button). The second player will sow their moves in the opposite direction. Once the first player makes their first move, both player's sow directions are set for the duration of the game no matter which button is used.  All UDIR_HOLES will apply to the game configuration.
Both mouse buttons will start a move no matter the sow direction. If the hole is marked as UDIR_HOLES, the button selects sow direction. On the other hand, if the hole is not marked as UDIR_HOLES, either button will sow in the prescribed direction. This can be useful, mechanism to remind yourself that on SPLIT sow, the left holes go CW by using the left button and the right holes go CCW by using the right button.
When PLAYALTDIR is not selected, any hole can be set as UDIR_HOLES to allow the user to override the sow_direct setting."

In single lap games, the hole's seeds are removed from play. In multilap games, the seeds are used to continue sowing.
  + When sowing, blocked holes on your own side of the board are skipped  and blocked holes on opponent's side are diverted out of play or captured.
  +  Game GOAL must be DEPRIVE and all of the associated restrictions apply. NOCAPTMOVES maybe used to prevent closing holes on the initial games moves. Capture mechanisms other than closing holes are not supported. The minimum move must be 1 and thus SOW_START is incompatible.  ALLOW_RULE may not be used to limit allowable moves.  SKIP_START and VISIT_OPP are not supported with SOW_BLKD_DIV.  MLAPS of LAPPER_NEXT is not supported with SOW_BLKD_DIV(_NR).
- SOW_BLKD_DIV_NR: Behaves the same as SOW_BLKD_DIV except that each player's rightmost hole cannot be closed. 
- OWN_SOW_CAPT_ALL: The hole OWNer captures all holes that are sown to meet the simple capture criteria no matter who sowed them.  The simple capture criteria are: evens, min, max and capture on. Other criteria are enforced: side of the board, unlocked, and not child.
  + The capture is done by the hole owner, so the non-sower may capture seeds while their opponents sows. If the game GOAL is TERRITORY the capturer is the hole owner; otherwise each player captures from their own side of the board no matter who is sowing. 
  + If MLAPS is LAPPER and the final seed sown for any lap meets the simple capture criteria for that hole, the contents of the hole are captured by the sower and not the hole owner and the turn is over. For CAPTTWOOUT, CAPT_NEXT and CROSSCAPT captures, the sower always does the final capture.
  + GRANDSLAM rules are not applied. NOCAPTMOVES prevents these capture for the first moves.
- SOW_CAPT_ALL: Similar to OWN_SOW_CAPT_ALL but only the SOWer captures seeds from the side specified by CAPT_SIDE. BOTH sower capturers from any hole. OPP sower capturer only from opponents holes.  OWN sower captures only from their own holes. 
  + If mlaps is LAPPER and the final seed sown for any lap meets the capture criteria, the contents of the hole are captured by the sower and not the hole owner and the turn is over.
  + GRANDSLAM rules are not applied. NOCAPTMOVES prevents this capture for the first number of specified moves.
- NO_SOW_OPP_2S: Don't sow into opponents holes with 2 seeds.
- CHANGE_DIR_LAP: Change the direction for each lap sown. Generally used with UDIR_HOLES so the player may choose the first direction.
- MAX_SOW: holes sow_param seeds are skipped when sowing. That is, holes will never contain more seeds than sow_param.
- LAP_CAPT: after each lapt check for a capture, if there is a capture continue sowing with another lap. If a basic capture is configured (evens, capt on, max or min), the hole after the captured seeds is drawn to continue lapping.
- NO_OPP_CHILD: do not sow into your opponents children."

These child holes are an extension of the stores and seeds in them count towards a win. Making a child stops any multiple lap sowing, moves cannot start from children, and they cannot be captured (except for special rules associated with WEGs).
- NOCHILD: children are not used.
- NORMAL: children are made when a final seeds sows a hole to CHILD_CVT. If stores are not included captures are instead moved into children, thus a player may not capture until they have created a child. 
- ONE_CHILD: only one child allowed per player.
  + Children must not be symmetrically opposite eachother. For example,  in a 9 hole per side game with holes numbered as follows, children may not be in the same numbered holes:
  + 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
  + 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
  + Depending on sow direction some holes are prohibited from being made children: 
  + CW & CCW:  the last of your opponents holes that you would sow into may not be made a child. CW holes numbered 1 above and CCW holes numberd 9 above.
  + SPLIT: no end holes may be made children.
  + Used to create tuzdek style children along with CHILD_RULE of OPP_ONLY.
- WEG: children maybe created in holes owned by the opponent. Ending a sow in an opponent's weg captures the seed just sown and one more (if there is one); generally, the player gets to play again (per CAPT_RTURN). WEGs are supported for TERRITORY games only (hole ownership required).
- BULL: create one bull if final seed sows to CHILD_CVT, create two bulls if the final two seeds are sown to CHILD_CVT-1 and CHILD_CVT (in either order).
- QUR: when a seed is sown into an empty hole on the player's side of the board and the opposite hole contains CHILD_CVT, create children in both holes: final seed location and opposite.
