<param about>
A description of the game, typically enough to remind the player what
the game options are.

New lines can be inserted with \n.

<param mx_access_m>
The multiplier for the access scorer. The access scorer computes how
many of the opponent's holes can be accessed for the given game state.

The access scorer is slow and therefore is prohibited from being used
in multilap games (MLAPS); games with user choice of move direction
(UDIR_HOLES); and games where hole owners are not predefined
(NO_SIDES). In these game configurations, the multiplier must be zero
to disable the access scorer.

Used only for minimax & negamax players.

<param ai_active>
Automatically activate the AI player. The AI player can be manually
deactivated, but it is selected for the starter it will start the
game.

<param algorithm>
The algorithm value is the name of the AI player algorithm (a string):

minimaxer: an Alpha-Beta Pruning MiniMaxer

negamaxer: minimaxer with a very minor optimization for alternating
turn games (no repeat turns). Uses minimaxer depths for difficulties.

montecarlo_ts: a Monte Carlo Tree Search player.

<param allow_rule>
Allow rules limit the holes from which moves may start. Disallowed
holes are not selectable.

- NONE: no special rule

- OPP_OR_EMPTY: Limit the allowable holes to those that end in an
empty hole or reach the opponents side of the board. Not supported
with UDIR_HOLES.

- SINGLE_TO_ZERO: Holes with single seeds may only be played if the
next hole is empty.  Not supported with UDIR_HOLES.

- SINGLE_ONLY_ALL: Holes with single seeds may only be played if all
holes are empty or have single seeds.

- SINGLE_ALL_TO_ZERO: Holes with single seeds may only be played if
all holes are empty or have single seeds and then only if the next
hole is empty.  Not supported with UDIR_HOLES.

- TWO_ONLY_ALL: Holes with two seeds may only be played if all holes
have two seeds.

- TWO_ONLY_ALL_RIGHT: Holes with two seeds may not be played, unless
all holes have two seeds, in which case the rightmost hole must be
played.

- FIRST_TURN_ONLY_RIGHT_TWO: The first turn must start from one of the
two rightmost holes.

- RIGHT_2_1ST_THEN_ALL_TWO: The first turn must start from one of the
two rightmost holes. Subsequent moves may only start from holes
without 2 seeds, unless all holes contain zero or 2 seeds.

- MOVE_ALL_HOLES_FIRST: a move must be initiated from each hole once
before a second move may be made from any hole.  This option is
incompatible with MOVEUNLOCK, CAPT_TYPE of TWO_OUT, and any PICKEXTRA.

- NOT_XFROM_1S: moves may not start from holes with a singleton
opposite it.

- OCCUPIED: The final seed of the sow must end in an occupied hole.

- RIGHT_HALF_FIRSTS: For the opening moves for each player, only allow
a move from the right side of board. If the baord size is odd, moves
may not be made from the center hole.

- RIGHT_HALF_1ST_OPE: For the opening moves for each player, only
allow a move from the right side of board. For subsequent moves,
OPP_OR_EMPTY is applied.

<param blocks>
Blocks remove holes from play and are shown on the UI with an X.

When used with ROUNDS, the holes not filled from the player with fewer
seeds are blocked and thus out of play for the round.

When used with DEPRIVE, SOW_BLCK_DIV and goal_param holes are closed
(blocked and removed from play) when sown to goal_param seeds.

<param capt_dir>
Determines the direction of captures when there are multiple captures.
CAPT_TYPE of NEXT and TWO_OUT require <nolink>CAPT_DIR be SOW.

- OPP_SOW: captures proceed in the direction opposite of the sow.

- SOW: captures continue in the same direction as the sow.

- BOTH: captures occur in both directions from the final hole sown.

<param capt_max>
Capture when the contents of the hole are less than or equal to
capt_max. Disable with 0 value.

When selected with other basic capture mechanisms, the capture
mechanisms are ANDed (all must be true for capture). Basic capture
mechanisms are: CAPT_MAX, CAPT_MIN, CAPT_ON and EVENS with
restrictions from OPPSIDECAPT, MOVEUNLOCK and not child holes of any
type.

MLAPS LAPPER sowing will stop the sowing on a final seed that would
capture based on the selected basic capture mechanisms.

Either SOW_RULE of OWN_SOW_CAPT_ALL or SOW_SOW_CAPT_ALL includes the
basic capture mechanisms.

<param capt_min>
Capture when the contents of the hole are greater than or equal to
capt_min. Disable with 0 value.

When selected with other basic capture mechanisms, the capture
mechanisms are ANDed (all must be true for capture). Basic capture
mechanisms are: CAPT_MAX, CAPT_MIN, CAPT_ON and EVENS with
restrictions from OPPSIDECAPT, MOVEUNLOCK and not child holes of any
type.

MLAP LAPPER sowing will stop sowing on a final seed that would capture
based on the selected basic capture mechanisms.

Either SOW_RULE of OWN_SOW_CAPT_ALL or SOW_SOW_CAPT_ALL includes the
basic capture mechanisms.

<param capt_on>
Capture when the contents of the hole are in the capt_on list. The
Mancala Games UI only has checkboxes for 1 to 5 seeds, but any number
may be put into the configuration file.

When selected with other basic capture mechanisms, the capture
mechanisms are ANDed (all must be true for capture). Basic capture
mechanisms are: CAPT_MAX, CAPT_MIN, CAPT_ON and EVENS   with
restrictions from OPPSIDECAPT, MOVEUNLOCK and not child holes of any
type.

MLAP LAPPER sowing will stop sowing on a final seed that would capture
based on the selected basic capture mechanisms.

Either SOWRULE of OWN_SOW_CAPT_ALL or SOW_SOW_CAPT_ALL includes the
basic capture mechanisms.

<param capt_rturn>
Controls repeat turn on captures. Making children is not a capture.

- NO_REPEAT: no repeat turn on capture.

- ALWAYS: always repeat turn if there is a capture.

- ONCE: only do a repeat turn on the first capture. Only two possible
moves are allowed.

<param capt_side>
Limits where captures maybe made:

- BOTH: no limitations

- OPP_SIDE: opposite side capture only.

- OWN_SIDE: captures on own side of board only.

- OPP_CONT: a multi-capture must begin on the opposite side of the
board but may continue onto your own side. Requires MULTICAPT.

- OWN_CONT: a multi-capture must begin on your own side of the board
and may continue onto your opponent's side. Requires multicapt.

- OPP_TERR: capture from opponent's holes only (territory GOAL games
only).

- OWN_TERR: capture from own holes only (territory goal games only).

<param capt_type>
Capture type.

- NONE: No other capture type.

- NEXT: Capture from the hole after the final seed sown. Captures in
may be in either direction (set via CAPT_DIR) and multiple captures
are supported. The hole tested for the basic capture criteria differs
when lap sowing or not:

  + When not lap sowing, basic capture rules are applied and capture
  side is checked on the hole from which the seeds will be captured.

  + When multiple lap sowing, the basic capture rules define when the
  multilap sowing will end. When the final seed of a lap meets the
  basic capture criteria, multilap sowing ends and the seeds in the
  next hole (defined by CAPT_DIR setting) are captured.

- TWO_OUT: Capture two holes out from the final hole sown but only if
the intervening hole is empty. This is sometimes called capturing
across the gap.

  + CAPT_DIR must be SOW. Basic capture rules and capture side are
  ignored (if a "capture while sowing" SOW_RULE is selected, these are
  applied to sowing).

  + When not lap sowing, the final hole sown must be occupied for
  capture two out (i.e. contains two or more seeds after sowing).

  + Multilap sowing does not stop to check for two out captures on
  each lap*. For LAPPER sow, captures are checked after the final seed
  ends lands in an empty hole. For LAPPER_NEXT sow, captures captures
  are checked when there are no seeds in the hole after the final seed
  sown.

  + *The SOW_RULE LAP_CAPT is supported for TWO_OUT captures with
  LAPPER sow.

  + If multiple captures are configured, captures continue while the
  pattern of empty hole followed by an occupied hole repeats.

- MATCH_OPP: capture when the number of seeds in the final hole sown
match the opposite-side hole. Seeds from both holes are captured.
Multiple captures maybe made in either direction. Multilap sowing does
stop for captures.

- SINGLETONS: capture all singletons.

- CAPT_OPP_1CCW: flag a capture if the final seed of a sow lands in
your own rightmost hole or on your opponent's side of the board. No
seeds are removed. Useful for causing a repeat turn and/or with
pickextra.

- PASS_STORE_CAPT: if your last seed of a sow falls into an empty
hole, your opponent passively captures the contents of your store. Use
CAPT_SIDE to limit where this effect occurs. MULTICAPT is not
supported.

- PULL_ACROSS: if your last seed of a sow falls into an empty hole,
pull any seeds from across the board into the final holw sown. Use
CAPT_SIDE to limit where this effect occurs. Multiple captures can be
configured (MULTICAPT) which pulls seeds across the board when holes
after the final hole sown are empty (CAPT_DIR must be the same as the
sow direction).

<param end_cond>

Conditions that end the game. If the game is ended, UNCLAIMED defines
what happens with any seeds left on the board and GOAL is used to
determine the winner.

All other game ending conditions still apply, e.g., the game will end
as soon as one player has more than half the seeds in a MAX_SEEDS
game.

- NO_ADDTL: no additional end conditions.

- CLEARED_OWN: end the game when the a player clears all their own
holes.

- CLEARED_OPP: end the game when your opponent does not have any
seeds.

- SEEDS_LIMIT:  end the game when unclaimed seeds in play are
end_param or fewer seeds.

- HOLE_SEED_LIMIT: end the game when all holes have end_param or fewer
seeds.

If the game is played in rounds, this condition will end a round
unless the game win conditions are met.

<param end_param>

Parameter for END_COND.

<param mx_child_cnt_m>
The multiplier for the child scorer. The child scorer counts the
number children each player has.

The child scorer may only be used on games with children. If the game
does not include children, the multiplier must be zero.

Used only for the minimax & negamax players.

<param child_cvt>
Defines the number of seeds required to make a child.

<param child_locs>
Locations where children can be made by each player. Child locations
are further limited by CHILD_RULE.

Some pattern are specified below with 5 designators per side as:
a b c d e
These are applied as: a is used for the first hole (left most), b the
second, d the second last, and e the last (rightmost), c is replicated
for all interior holes.

The allowable children are designated by: T - top/north player, B -
bottom/south player. N - neither player.

For shorter boards, the pattern is generated using assignments (a b c
d e) as:

board length 2: a e

board length 3: a c e

board length 4: a b d e

For boards longer than 5, the middle specifier is duplicated as
needed:

board length >= 5: a b c c c ... c d e

- ANYWHERE: children may be made anywhere.

- ENDS_ONLY: children may be made in the end holes only.

  + TB N N N TB

  + TB N N N TB

- NO_ENDS: children may only be made on internal holes, no end holes.

  + N TB TB TB N

  + N TB TB TB N

- INV_ENDS_PLUS_MID: children may be made by each player on the
opposite side ends and all own side middle holes.

  + B T T T B

  + T B B B T

- ENDS_PLUS_ONE_OPP: Either player may make children in any end hole,
but the next inner hole can only be made on the opposite side.

  +  Used for Walda type children: Each player may create up to 6
  walda: on either end of each side of the board and the next two
  outer holes on their own side of the board. Note that there are only
  8 total places that walda maybe created.

  + TB B N B TB

  + TB T N T TB

- NO_OWN_RIGHT: children may not be made in your own rightmost hole.
Direction is from the prespective of the player making the child.

  + B TB TB TB TB

  + TB TB TB TB T

- NO_OPP_RIGHT: children may not be made in the opposite rightmost
hole. Direction is from the prespective of the player making the
child.

  + TB TB TB TB T

  + B TB TB TB TB

- NO_OPP_LEFT: children may not be made in the opposite leftmost hole.
Direction is from the prespective of the player making the child.

  + T TB TB TB TB

  + TB TB TB TB B

- NOT_SYM_OPP:  Children must not be symmetrically opposite each
other. NO_OPP_LEFT is also applied. For example, in a 9 hole per side
game with holes numbered as follows, children may not be in the same
numbered holes:

  + 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

  + 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

- NOT_FACING: Children must not directly opposite eachother.
NO_OPP_RIGHT is also applied.

- ENDS_PLUS_ALL_OPP: Children may be made in any end hole, but only
your opponents interior holes.

  + TB B B B TB
  + TB T T T TB

- FIXED_ONE_RIGHT: At the game start, each player has a child in their
own rightmost hole. Additional children may not be created.

<param child_rule>
Additional child creation requirements may be set. These are in
addition to location restrictions specified by CHILD_LOCS. If the
CHILD_TYPE allows making more than one child, the child_rule is
applied to hole in which the final seed was sown; the second hole does
not need to meet the criteria.

- NONE: no additional restrictions.

- OPP_SIDE_ONLY: Only make children on the opposite side of the board.

- OWN_SIDE_ONLY: Only make children on your own side of the board.

- OPPS_ONLY_NOT_1ST: OPP_SIDE_ONLY and don't make a child in the first
hole on the opponent's side with one seed.

- OPP_OWNER_ONLY: Only make children in your opponents holes. Valid
only for territory GOAL games.

- OWN_OWNER_ONLY: Only make children in your own holes. Valid only for
territory GOAL games.

- NOT_1ST_OPP: Don't make a child in the first hole on the opponent's
side with one seed. Not supported for territory games or games which
employ blocks.

<param child_type>
For all child_types other than RAMs: games with children allow players
to claim holes. These child holes are an extension of the stores and
seeds in them count towards a win. Making a child stops any multilap
sowing, moves cannot start from children, and they cannot be captured
(except for special rules associated with WEGs). Children may be
created as allowed by both CHILD_LOCS and CHILD_RULE.

- NOCHILD: children are not used.

- NORMAL: children are made when a final seed sows a hole to
CHILD_CVT. If stores are not included captures are instead moved into
children, thus a player may not capture until they have created a
child.

- RESERVED: unused value

- ONE_CHILD: only one child allowed per player.

  + Used to create tuzdik style children along with CHILD_RULE of
  OPP_ONLY and CHILD_LOCS of NOT_SYM_OPP.

- WEG: Ending a sow in an opponent's weg captures the seed just sown
and one more (if there is one); generally, the player gets to play
again (per CAPT_RTURN). WEGs are generally used in territory games
with CHILD_RULE of OPP_OWNER_ONLY.

- BULL: create one bull if final seed sows to CHILD_CVT, create two
bulls if the final two seeds are sown to CHILD_CVT-1 and CHILD_CVT (in
either order).

- QUR: when a seed is sown into an empty hole and the opposite hole
contains CHILD_CVT, create children in both holes: final seed location
and opposite. Generally used with SOW_RULE of OWN_SIDE_ONLY.

- RAM: rams are created in any hole that would cycle the board back to
your own side of the board when sown. Moves may not start from rams,
and seeds in rams do count in the game outcome, but they may be
captured. Rams are cleared when captured.  Ram type children ignore
the CHILD_CVT setting.


<param crosscapt>
If the last sown seed is put in an empty hole, seeds on the opposite
side of the board are captured. The capture of those seeds can be
limited by CAPT_MAX, CAPT_MIN, CAPT_ON, EVENS, MOVEUNLOCK,
OPPSIDECAPT. For example, crosscapt with evens will only capture when
there are an even number of seeds in the opposite hole.

SOW_RULE of SOW_CAPT_ALL does not do this capture.

<param difficulty>
The default difficulty for the game. Valid values are 0 for easiest
and 3 for hardest. The difficulty can be changed at play time, even
during game play, in the Mancala UI.

<param mx_easy_rand_a>
If the game is being played on easy mode (game difficult of easy/0), a
random value may be added to the static evaluation. This can be done
to induce errors into the ai player's game play. A random value is
selected between -mx_easy_rand_a and +easy_rand.

The specific value for this should be selected based on the ranges of
the parameters and multipliers.

Used only for minimax & negamax players.

<param mx_empties_m>
The multiplier for the empties scorer. The empties scorer counts the
number empty holes each player has on the board.

Used only for minimax & negamax players.

<param evens>
Capture when a hole has an even number of seeds, greater than 0. When
selected with other basic capture mechanisms, the capture mechanisms
are ANDed (all must be true for capture). Basic capture mechanisms
are: CAPT_MAX, CAPT_MIN, CAPT_ON and EVENS with restrictions from
OPPSIDECAPT, MOVEUNLOCK and not child holes of any type.

MLAPS LAPPER sowing will stop the sowing on a final seed that would
capture based on the selected basic capture mechanisms.

Either SOW_RULE of OWN_SOW_CAPT_ALL or SOW_SOW_CAPT_ALL includes the
basic capture mechanisms.

<param extra_tops>
The <nolink>EXTRA_TOPS parameter is only used while editing.
Any top level tags in the game file that are not the standard tags
are collected for editing. 
An XML-like format is used, but do not include the closing tags.

On Save, the tags are copied back to the top level. 
White space is stripped off the right side of values, and any 
that are still multi-line will be saved to the test_section.
Any value can be forced to be stored in the text_section by including
<txt>.

Extra tags may be included in a game configuration file. Generally
included tags are listed below. The script play_mancala allows
filtering the game list by many of these values on the About tab.

- <b class="inhead">rules</b>: the source for the game rules is often
included.

- <b class="inhead">deviation</b>: descriptions where the rules are
not implemented exactly as the source listed in the rules tag. If
there is more than one deviation, numbered tags may be used, e.g.
deviation 1, deviation 2.

- <b class="inhead">origin</b>: generally one of traditional, modern,
or example.

- <b class="inhead">region</b>: generally one or more of the
following: Africa, Eastern Africa, Central Africa, Northern Africa,
Western Africa, Southern Africa, Asia, Central Asia, South Asia,
Southeast Asia, Western Asia, East Asia, Americas, Caribbean, Europe.
Use the most specific region.

- Other common tags are <b class="inhead">references</b> and 
<b class="inhead">note</b>s. The "Notes" filter in play_mancala includes
games with tags including note, reference, question and lagniappe.

An example of extra_tags:

<pre class="fixed">
<rules>
Russ, Laurence. Mancala Games. 1984. p33.

<deviation>
Round tally goal is used so that the round loser can start each new game. 
In play without rounds, the starter always alternates.

<origin>
traditional

<region>
Eastern Africa
</pre>

<param mx_evens_m>
The multiplier for the even scorer. The even scorer counts the number
of holes with an even number of seeds. This is useful to use when the
capture mechanism is evens.

Used only for minimax & negamax players.

<param game_class>
The name of the Game Class. One of:

- <b class="inhead">Mancala</b>

  + Allows setting all parameters.

  + Some combinations of parameters are not implemented
  (NotImplementedError generated) or prohibited (GameInfoError
  reported). Other combinations are not recommended and either
  generate an actual warning (UserWarning) or a 'gentle warning' (a
  print to the console--if there is one).

  + Most preconfigured games use this class.

- <b class="inhead">NorthSouthCycle</b>

  + A two-cycle game class in which each player only sows on their own
  side of the board. If NO_SIDES is configured, either player may sow
  on either side of the board, but the seeds will remain on that side
  of the board.

  + Players may effect eachother's play with CROSSCAPT, PICKEXTRA, Qur
  CHILD_TYPE, and others.

  + Weg children are only supported for no_sides games. Prohibited
  options include: GOAL of Territory; MUSTSHARE; some SOW_RULE; some
  CHILD_RULE; and MLAP_CONT of OPP_SIDE, OWN_SIDE and VISIT_OPP are
  prohibited.

  + NS_Kalah is a preconfigured game using this class.

- <b class="inhead">EastWestCycle</b>

  + A two-cycle game class in which player's control east and west
  sides of the board, and seeds are sown in those cycles.

  + Without specialized extension of this game class, it appears to
  only support race type games, e.g. who can clear their holes faster.
  Their is little or no player interaction supported in the Mancala
  Games engine.

- <b class="inhead">BearOff</b>

  + A flexible game class that does Backgammon-like bear off board
  clearing after the game reaches a state where only singletons are
  left. When a sow reaches the player's end of the board, any
  remaining seeds in hand are removed from play (actually moved to
  their store).

  + This is intendend for clear and deprive games, though this is not
  enforced. It turns the end game into a race to see which player
  accomplishes the goal first.

  + The transition from normal sow to bear-off sowing is made on the
  first move when all of the seeds on the board are singletons (i.e.,
  all holes <=1 seeds). Games may ended via an outright win before
  this condition is achieved.

  + Even if a future moves starts with > 1 seeds in a hole, the normal
  sow is not resumed.

  + NO_SIDES is not supported and MIN_MOVE must be 1.  There are no
  other limitations unique to the BearOff game class.

  + Andada is a preconfigured game usinging this class.

- Diffusion (also a game)

  + A game class with has a unique sow method and win condition.
  Players control the east/west sides of the board.

  + The game is basically preconfigured, only the board size can be
  changed to any even size. Game goal must be CLEAR.

- <b class="inhead">DiffusionV2</b>

  + Like <nolink>Diffusion but players control the typical north/south
  sides of the board. Used as a game variant in the game Diffusion.

- SameSide  (also a game)

  + A game class in which seeds are only sown on the player's own side
  of the board. If a capture is made, the capturer chooses one of
  their opponent's holes to put the seeds into. All seeds go into
  exactly one hole.

  +  The game goal must be CLEAR. Sow direction is unconstrained.
  Capture mechanisms must be limited to one side of the board: basic
  captures, next, and two out.

- Ohojichi  (also a game)

  + A <nolink>SameSide game but the board is divided east/west instead
  of north/south.

  + Most parameter restrictions from <nolink>SameSide apply to
  <nolink>Ohojichi. For <nolink>Ohojichi, if UDIR_HOLES is used, all
  holes must be UDIR; capture side must be BOTH.

- <b class="inhead">ShareOne</b>

  + A game class that forces a share of one seed when your opponent
  does not have any seeds at the start of your turn. You may choose
  which hole the seed comes from but it must be a hole with at least
  two seeds. After sharing the one seed, the sharer gets a repeat
  turn.

  + The following options are prohibited: BLOCKS, MUSTSHARE, NO_SIDES,
  or any repeat turn option (CAPT_RTURN, SOW_OWN_STORE, XC_SOWN or
  GRANDSLAM of LEGAL_SHARE). The game GOAL must not be TERRITORY.

- <nolink><b class="inhead">ZigZag</b>

  + A flexible game class with a unique zigzag sowing pattern. See
  ZigZag game help for the creators of the pattern.

  + The sowing is done in a zigzag fashion: Sowing is done towards the
  center line of the board. The first hole sown is one hole towards
  the center and on the opposite side of the board, when the end of
  the board is reached sow directly across from the last hole. The sow
  pattern cycles through each hole of the board before visiting a hole
  a second time.

  + Games with min_move of 1, no user directed sow direction holes,
  and an even number of holes, will not allow a player to move a
  single seed that was just moved across the center of the board back
  across the board. This restriction only applies to the very next
  turn.

  + SOW_DIRECT must be TOCENTER. If the size of the board is odd, the
  center hole must be in the User Chooses Direction list. There are no
  other limitations unique to the <nolink>ZigZag game class.

<param goal>
The overall goal of the game. Defines how a player wins.

Goals that start with RND_ are 'round tally games'. Multiple games are
played and the overall winner is determined by the tally type (see the
options below).

- MAX_SEEDS: The goal is to collect the maximum number of seeds.

  + If the game is not played in rounds, the game will end when one
  player has more than half of the total seeds.

  + If the game is played in rounds, the round end condition is
  decided by ROUNDS. These games end when one player has collected
  sufficient seeds to prevent the opponent from filling the required
  number of holes. Generally, the required number of holes is one, but
  this may be increased by setting goal_param.

  + In MAX_SEEDS/ROUNDS games the player only controls the holes on
  their side of the board, while, in TERRITORY games a player may
  control holes on either side of the board.

- DEPRIVE: eliminate all your opponent's seeds. If a player has no
seeds at the start of their turn, they lose. If the current player
doesn't have any seeds at the end of their turn, they lose.

  + GRANDSLAM must be legal for deprive games.

  + Deprive games can be played in tallied rounds--no other support
  for rounds is provided. Use a goal of RND_WIN_COUNT_DEP. ROUNDS must
  be NO_MOVES, ROUND_FILL is ignored, and goal_param should be set to
  the number of round wins required for a game win. For example, a
  "best of 7 games" would have goal_param of 4.

  + Deprive games cannot use children and the following options are
  prohibited: MOVEUNLOCK, MUSTPASS and MUSTSHARE.

- TERRITORY: claim ownership of holes by collecting more seeds than
your opponent. Claiming ownership of goal_param holes wins the game.

  + Territory games are generally played in rounds. A winner is
  declared for each round based on the condition set in ROUNDS.

  + After each round, the ownership of holes is decided by the number
  of seeds captured in the previous round. The winner's collected
  seeds are used to fill as many holes as they can with NBR_START
  seeds, first on their own side of the board and then their
  opponent's side.  Next, if they have more than half the seeds
  required to fill another hole, ownership of one more hole is
  allocated to them. The remaining holes are allocated to the round
  loser.

  + This ownership of holes only applies to the next round played;
  ownership of holes varies with each round played. Hole ownership may
  be reclaimed or lost each round.

  + The Ownership Arrows Display option may be used to show hole
  ownership with long thin arrows in each hole. The arrows point up
  for the top/north player and down for the bottom/south player. If
  facing players is set, the arrows point towards the hole owner.

  + A move maybe started from any hole owned by a player, no matter
  the side of the board--with any restrictions based on game rules.
  Captures are determined by CAPT_SIDE and hole ownership--not by side
  of the board. For example, if a player may only capture from their
  opponent's holes (per game rules), but their opponent owns a hole on
  their side of the board; its seeds may be captured by that player.

  + In territory games, all holes are available for play each round,
  though the ALLOW_RULE or MUSTSHARE may limit which holes may be
  played on any given turn.

  + In a territory game without rounds, the winner is not declared
  until one player has enough seeds to claim goal_param holes.

  + Territory games require STORES and that GOAL_PARAM be set to a
  value between the number of holes and two times the number of holes.

  + Territory games are incompatible with NO_SIDES, GRANDSLAM of
  NOT_LEGAL, ALLOW_RULE of OPP_OR_EMPTY. Territory games may only use
  a ROUND_FILL of NOT_APPLICABLE or UCHOWN.

- CLEAR: clear seeds from your own holes.

  + If a player has seeds, moves must always be possible so MIN_MOVE
  must be 1 and ALLOW_RULE of single_to_zero, single_all_to_zero,
  not_xfrom_1s and occupied may not be used.

  + GRANDSLAM must be legal for clear games.

  + Clear games can be played in tallied rounds--no other support for
  rounds is provided. Use a goal of RND_WIN_COUNT_CLR. ROUNDS must be
  NO_MOVES, ROUND_FILL is ignored, and goal_param should be set to the
  number of round wins required for a game win.

  + Clear games cannot use children and the following options are
  prohibited: MOVEUNLOCK, MUSTPASS and MUSTSHARE.

- RND_WIN_COUNT_MAX: win goal_param rounds of MAX_SEEDS games.
ROUND_FILL is not used; each round is setup as the start of the game.

- RND_SEED_COUNT: collect goal_param seeds across several rounds.
ROUND_FILL is not used; each round is setup as the start of the game.

- RND_EXTRA_SEEDS: collect goal_param extra seeds (winner - loser
seeds). ROUND_FILL is not used; each round is setup as the start of
the game.

- RND_POINTS: score goal_param points. WIN is 1 point. WIN and skunk
(> 3/4 of total seeds) is 2 points. ROUND_FILL is not used; each round
is setup as the start of the game.

- RND_WIN_COUNT_CLR: win goal_param rounds of CLEAR games. ROUND_FILL
is not used; each round is setup as the start of the game.

- RND_WIN_COUNT_DEP: win goal_param rounds of DEPRIVE games.
ROUND_FILL is not used; each round is setup as the start of the game.

- IMMOBILIZE: prevent your opponent from having a valid move at the
start of their turn.

  + This is subtly different than deprive in two ways. First, the game
  will not end until the current player does not have a valid move.
  Second, the last mover wins the game even if they do not have any
  seeds.

  + Immobilize games cannot use children or repeat turns. GRANDSLAM
  must be legal. The following options are prohibited: MOVEUNLOCK,
  MUSTPASS and MUSTSHARE.

  + Immobilize games can be played in tallied rounds--no other support
  for rounds is provided. Use a goal of RND_WIN_COUNT_IMB. ROUNDS must
  be NO_MOVES, ROUND_FILL is ignored, and goal_param should be set to
  the number of round wins required for a game win.

- RND_WIN_COUNT_IMB: win goal_param rounds of IMMOBILIZE games.
ROUND_FILL is not used; each round is setup as the start of the game.

<param goal_param>
GOAL of Territory: defines the number of holes needed for a win. The
number of holes for each player are computed by rounding the number of
seeds collected divided by the number of start seeds per hole.

Goal of Max Seeds and ROUNDS: defines the minimum number of holes each
player must have to continue the game. The player with fewer seeds
must have enough seeds to fill goal_param holes each with start_seeds
to continue playing.  There is no rounding of seed counts as in
territory games.

RND_* Goals: number of specified parameter for win.

<param grandslam>
A grandslam is when your opponent has seeds at the start of your turn,
and you capture them all with one move. This option selects what to
do:

- LEGAL: the seeds are captured

- NOT_LEGAL: you may not capture all your opponent's seeds, a move
which would do so is not allowed

- NO_CAPT: you may sow the seeds, but the capture is not performed

- OPP_GETS_REMAIN: if you capture all your opponent's seeds, they
capture all your remaining seeds, and the game is over. The winner is
determined by game goal. Seeds picked because of PICKEXTRA
PICK*LASTSEEDS go to the current player and not the opponent.

- LEAVE_LEFT: the capture is performed from all but the leftmost hole
from the sower perspective. This might leave your opponents without
seeds or might not capture any seeds.

- LEAVE_RIGHT: the capture is performed from all but the rightmost
hole from the sower perspective. This might leave your opponents
without seeds.

- LEGAL_SHARE: the seeds are captured and the capturer must do a
repeat turn. Generally, used with MUSTSHARE to force the capturer to
try to share seeds.

Grandslam must be legal to use UDIR_HOLES.

<param help_file>
A secondary help file providing additional game details over the
'About' text. It is included as a link in the Mancala Game
Configurations html file.

<param holes>
Number of holes on each side of the board. Values of 2 to 21 are
supported.

<param mcts_bias>
Bias for the Monte Carlo Tree search algorithm for each difficulty
level (0-3). A larger bias encourages game tree exploration but
defocuses the exploration from the best choices. This is critical in
avoiding getting stuck in sub-optimal move choices.

Value is divided by 1000.

<param mcts_nodes>
Number of game tree expansions to perform each time we pick a new
move. One value for each difficulty level (0-3).

<param mcts_pouts>
Number of end games played out from each expanded node. One value for
each difficulty level (0-3).

<param min_move>
The minimum number of seeds a hole must have for it to be an allowable
move start hole.

<param mlaps>
Determines if seeds from more than the initial start hole are picked
up and sown:

- OFF: Single lap sowing. Seeds from the start hole are sown,
typically, one per hole until expended.

- LAPPER: If the first sow ends in a hole with more than one seed,
pick up all the seeds and continue sowing another lap. Note that lap
here does not mean a full circuit of the board, only an individual sow
operation. In general, sowing laps continues in this manner until the
final seed of a lap reaches an empty hole. There are games with other
conditions for ending a multilap sow such as making a capture or
child.

  + Several values of SOW_RULE perform an operation after each lap
  sown: SOW_BLKD_DIV(_NR) closes the final hole and CHANGE_DIR_LAP
  changes the direction of sowing after each lap.

- LAPPER_NEXT: For lapper_next sowing, the number of seeds in the last
sown hole of lap does not matter. Instead, if the hole after the last
sown hole has any seeds, those seeds are used to continue sowing the
next lap. Sowing continues until the hole after the lap's final seed
is empty. There are games with other conditions for ending a multilap
sow such as making a capture or making a child.

  + A SOW_RULE of CHANGE_DIR_LAP changes the direction of sowing after
  each lap. SOW_BLKD_DIV(_NR) is not supported for LAPPER_NEXT.

Multilap games may get stuck in seemingly endless sowing loops. If
more than 75 laps are sown, the computer will end the game using the
same mechanism as the menu command <a
href="mancala_help.html#gamemenu">End Game</a> based on GOAL and
UNCLAIMED.

<param mlap_cont>

An additional limit on continuing mlap sowing:

- NONE: no additional reasons

- ON_PARAM: continue mlaps sowing when last sown hole is mlap_param

- GREQ_PARAM: continue mlaps sowing when last sown hole is greater
than or equal to mlap_param

- OWN_SIDE: continue mlaps sowing only from own side of the board

- OPP_SIDE: continue mlaps sowing only from opposite side of the board

- VISIT_OPP: continue mlaps sowing only if the opposite side of the
board was sown on the first lap


<param mlap_param>

Parameter for the Lap Continue Reason.

<param mm_depth>
The depth that the minimaxer or negamaxer will search the game tree
from the current node. One value for each difficulty.

<param move_one>
Only valid when SOW_START is set. Changes the SOW_START behavior so
that if there is only one seed in the hole, it is moved in the sow
direction by one hole.

<param moveunlock>
Holes in the game start each game and round locked. Captures may not
be made from locked holes. Starting a sow from a hole unlocks it
allowing future captures.

<param multicapt>
An int to describe possible multicaptures:

 0 no multiple captures.

 -1: After the initial capture, continue capturing as long as the
 capture conditions are met. This multiple capture may happen in the
 sow direction (unsown holes); in the opposite direction (sown holes);
 or in both directions  as selected with CAPT_DIR.

 1 .. holes: if <nolink>CAPT_DIR is SOW or OPP_SOW, capture at most
 the specified number of holes that meet the capture conditions. If
 <nolink>CAPT_DIR is BOTH, the number of seeds captured depends also
 on the capture mechanism: If the capture type is NEXT, there will be
 the multicapt number of captures in each direction. Otherwise, if the
 initial hole is captured, then one less than the multicapt is
 captured in each direction.

See individual capture mechanism for any unique requirements.

<param mustpass>
When a player has no allowable moves on their turn, they must pass and
continue to do so until they have allowable moves, or the game is
over. The game is over when there is a clear winner or tie condition,
or when neither player has an allowable move.

<param mustshare>
If an opponent has no moves at the start of your turn, you must make
seeds available to them, if you can.

This condition is enforced by only activating holes in the UI which
will make seeds available to the opponent. If used with UDIR_HOLES,
grids are used to show which direction cannot be sown.

<param name>
The game name which may have spaces. Used for the window title and the
filename (with spaces replaced with underscores).

<param nbr_start>
The number of seeds in each hole at the start of a game when
START_PATTERN is ALL_EQUAL. For the RANDOM start pattern, this is the
total number of seeds to be placed. Other sow patterns use this as the
number of seeds for some holes in the associated patterns.

<param no_sides>
Moves maybe made from any hole, independent of the side of the board.

<nolink>NO_SIDES is incompatible with BLOCKS, GRANDSLAM, MOVEUNLOCK,
MUSTPASS, MUSTSHARE, BLOCKS, and ROUND_FILL. <nolink>NO_SIDES games
played in rounds must use a round tally GOAL.

Care must be taken when using <nolink>NO_SIDES without stores because
the color of the holes is the only way to know whose turn it is. The
colors used for holes can be controlled for each game in the
mancala.ini file. A gentle warning (console print) is raised NO_SIDES
is used without STORES.

The test for CAPT_SIDE might not behave as expected for games that are
not north/south; that is, some games not built on the Mancala game
class. Specifically, the board side ranges are used for the test, so
if they are patched, the test might not be a north or south test, but
still might be what you want. A gentle warning (console print) is
raised.

<param nocaptmoves>
Don't allow captures or closing of holes (SOW_RULE of SOW_BLKD_DIV)
for the first specified number of moves of the game or round.

<param nosinglecapt>
If the selected start hole has exactly one seed, no capture may be
made with it.

<param pickextra>
Rules to allow taking of more than otherwise captured or picked seeds:

- NONE: Nothing extra

- PICKCROSS: Take the seeds from the opposite side of the board.

- PICKOPPBASIC: Take seeds from your opponent's holes that meet the
basic capture criteria (capt_min, capt_max, capt_on, and evens).

- PICKLASTSEEDS: If there are the number of starts seeds or fewer
left, the current player collects them, and the game is over. This
rule is applied at the end of each turn, even if there is not a
capture because the sow phase may have reduced the seed count.

- PICK2XLASTSEEDS: If there are twice the number of start seeds or
fewer, the round starter picks them. This rule is applied at the end
of each turn, even if there is not a capture because the sow phase may
have reduced the seed count.

- PICKFINAL: If there was a capture, take the seeds from the final
hole sown. These seeds are not taken if the hole is locked or a child.
This option is useful for capture next and two out.

- PICKCROSSMULT: On multiple captures, take the seeds across from each
hole captured.

In terms of GRANDSLAM, these picks are considered captures.

<param prescribed>
The first sow of the game maybe defined by a specific rule. Prescribed
openings are different than start patterns because the player may
choose the sow start point. SOW_STORES and SOW_RULE are ignored during
the prescribed openings.

- NONE: there is no prescribed opening move.

- BASIC_SOWER: the first sow is a basic pick up the seeds and drop
them one at a time in each hole ignoring any other sow parameters.
Other sow parameters will be enacted afterward. This can be used to
force the first sow of an MLAPS game to be a single sow.

- MLAPS_SOWER: the first sow follows basic rules of multi-lap sowing
(LAPPER). Other sow parameters will be enacted afterward.

- SOW1OPP: at least one seed must be sown on the opponents side of the
board which is accomplished by sowing as normal until the final seed,
then any remaining holes on the player's side are skipped and the last
seed is sown in the opponents first hole (based on current sow
direction). This prescribed opening is used for the first two moves of
a game (including any repeat turns).

- PLUS1MINUS1: proceed from the selected hole by moving one seed from
the next hole into the following hole, next skip that hole and repeat
moving seed forward. After cycling the board, capture across from the
opening hole.

- ARNGE_LIMIT: the first move may be used to rearrange the seeds
(opponent is same layout). If the first move is not used for
rearrangement, captures and child creation are not allowed from the
starter until the second player makes a child or captures.

- NO_UDIR_FIRSTS: the first move by each player (including repeat
turns) is sown in SOW_DIRECT direction, which must be CW or CCW, on
subsequent moves the player chooses the direction.

<param presowcapt>
Capture type that occurs before sowing:

- NONE: No capture before sowing.

- CAPT_ONE: Capture 1 seed from the draw. If MLAPS, capture 1 seed per
lap.

- ALL_SINGLE_XCAPT: Capture the seeds across from all singles.

- DRAW_1_XCAPT: When drawing 1 seed, capture any seeds on the other
side of the board.

<param mx_rturn_a>
A value used to encourage or discourage repeat turns. The value is
added in for the current player and subtracted off the score for the
opposing playing. Use a positive value to encourage the AI player to
repeat turns.

This parameter may only be used for games in which repeated turns are
possible (SOW_STORES, CAPT_RTURN or XC_SOWN).

Used only for minimax & negamax players.

<param round_fill>
The round fill method determines which holes are filled and how many
seeds they are filled with when setting up for a new round.

Several round fill mechanisms use the same general approach called the
Empty Hole Method. The loser of the previous round will end up with
empty holes. These holes are not playable if BLOCKS are used;
otherwise, they are playable. This method is not used for RND_* GOAL
games.

The seeds each player accumulated in the previous round are
distributed into holes with exactly the same number in each (NBR_START
seeds). The winner will fill all their holes and put any remaining
seeds into their own store. The loser will fill as many holes as they
can with nbr_start seeds and put any remaining seeds (fewer than
nbr_start) into their own store.

LEFT_FILL, RIGHT_FILL and OUTSIDE_FILL define which holes that the
loser must fill. UCHOOSE allows the loser to choose which holes have
seeds.

- NOT_APPLICABLE: round fill doesn't need to be specified: either the
game not played in rounds (CLEAR & DEPRIVE games included) or game
goal is TERRITORY without UCHOWN (see below, all holes filled).

- LEFT_FILL: fill the round loser's holes from the player's left with
nbr_start seeds each.

- RIGHT_FILL: fill the round loser's holes from the player's right
with nbr_start seeds each.

- OUTSIDE_FILL: fill the round loser's holes from the outside ends
toward the middle with nbr_start seeds each. Leftmost, rightmost, 2nd
leftmost, 2nd rightmost, etc. until the seeds are used up.

- EVEN_FILL: fill all holes (both sides) with the same number of
seeds; determined by dividing the loser's seeds by the number of holes
per side. If that is not playable based on the minimum number of seeds
required for a move (MIN_MOVE); extra seeds are put in each player's
leftmost hole. Any extra seeds are put in each player's store.

- SHORTEN: the number of holes that the round loser can fill with
NBR_START seeds are filled on both sides, other holes are left empty.
Holes are filled opposite each other. If BLOCKS is selected, the board
is shortened to the number of holes filled (empty holes are blocked
and out of play). If the game uses children, they will not be created
if the board size is reduced to 3 or less.

- UCHOOSE: allow user to choose which holes have seeds (are not
blocked) when ROUNDS and BLOCKS are used.

- UMOVE: allow the loser to choose where seeds are placed. At least
one seed must be placed in each hole and the game must be playable (at
least one hole has MIN_MOVE seeds), remaining seeds are placed in the
store. The winner's layout is the same layout but reflected and their
extra seeds are placed in their store.

- UCHOWN: The only round fill supported for territory games and only
territory games. The winner may choose which holes they control.

- SHORTEN_ALL: SHORTEN but all of the loser's seeds are put on the
board thus one hole might not have 'nbr_start' seeds. The winner gets
the same number of seeds put into play.

- LOSER_ONLY: Only the loser's holes are refilled based on the number
of seeds captured and on their side of the board. Any blocks (if used)
on their side of the board are cleared. The loser may choose which
holes have seeds and which are empty and (possibly) blocked.

  + The winner's side of the board is left unchanged: seeds left as
  is, blocks left in place, and seeds in the store remain. If the
  winner's side of the board is not playable, a new game is started.

  + NO_SIDES, children and locks are not supported. UNCLAIMED and
  QUITTER must both be HOLE_OWNER.

<param round_starter>
Defines which player starts 2nd and subsequent rounds:

- ALTERNATE: the round starter alternates.

- LOSER: the loser of the previous round starts the current round.

- WINNER: the winner of the previous round starts the current round.

- LAST_MOVER: the player that made the last move of the previous round
starts the new round.

<param rounds>
When rounds are employed, each round may end under conditions that do
not win the overall game. The board is then setup again per the game
rules, generally with some feature changed based on the previous
round: hole ownership, holes out of play, a shortened board. Play
continues in rounds until either player meets the overall game winning
condition.

If the game is played in rounds, it defines how each round ends:

- NO_ROUNDS: the game is not played in rounds

- HALF_SEEDS: each round ends when one player has more than half the
seeds

- NO_MOVES: When MUSTSHARE is set, each round ends when neither player
has a valid move. When MUSTSHARE is not set, each round ends when a
player does not have a valid move at the start of their turn.

- END_S_SEEDS: End the round when there are number of start seeds or
fewer in play.

- END_2S_SEEDS: End the round when there are twice the number of start
seeds or fewer in play.

For example: In Weg, each round ends when neither player has a valid
move. The board is then set up again after determining who owns what
territory (holes). Rounds continue until one player has claimed
sufficient territory to be declared the game winner (e.g., ownership
of 10 or more holes).

In the case of a round win or tie a new starter is determined via
ROUND_STARTER and  the board is reset according to ROUND_FILL.

BLOCKS are used in many games and set between rounds based on the seed
placement. TERRITORY GOAL games adjust hole ownership between rounds.

<param mx_seeds_m>
The multiplier for the seeds scorer. The seeds scorer computes how
many seeds each player has on the game board that are not in children.

Used only for minimax & negamax players.

<param skip_start>
When sowing a second or subsequent circuit of the board, skip the
start hole. This will leave the start hole empty for single lap games.

In multilap games, the start hole for the current lap is skipped.
Second or subsequent laps may sow into the original start hole.

<param sow_direct>
Direction of sow:

- CW: clockwise

- SPLIT: left-side holes sow counter-clockwise and right-side holes
sow clockwise, an odd middle hole must be set in UDIR_HOLES.

  + Games with min_move of 1 and with end holes whose sow direction
  cannot be user selected, will not allow a player to move a single
  seed that was just moved across the board sides back across the
  board.  This restriction only applies to the very next turn.

- CCW: counter-clockwise

- PLAYALTDIR: on the first move of the game, the first player chooses
their sow direction using the UDIR_HOLES method (by mouse button). The
second player will sow their moves in the opposite direction. Once the
first player makes their first move, both player's sow directions are
set for the duration of the game no matter which button is used. All
UDIR_HOLES will apply to the game configuration.

- EVEN_ODD_DIR: holes with even seeds sow clockwise and holes with odd
seeds sow counter-clockwise.

- TOCENTER: sow towards the horizontal center line of the board based
on hole location. This sows in the opposite directions used by SPLIT.

Both mouse buttons will start a move no matter the sow direction. If
the hole is marked as UDIR_HOLES, the button selects sow direction. On
the other hand, if the hole is not marked as UDIR_HOLES, either button
will sow in the prescribed direction. This can be a useful mechanism
to remind yourself that on SPLIT sow, the left holes go CW by using
the left button and the right holes go CCW by using the right button.

When PLAYALTDIR is not selected, any hole can be set as UDIR_HOLES to
allow the user to override the sow_direct setting.

<param sow_stores>
Determines if seeds should be sown into stores. When the final seed is
sown into a store, the sower gets another turn.

- NEITHER: do not sow into either store

- OWN: only sow into own store, but not opponents store

- BOTH: sow into both stores

<param sow_param>
A general parameter for sowing. Usage is based on other sow options:

Sow rule of SOW_BLKD_DIV or SOW_BLKD_DIV_NR: defines the number of
seeds needed to close/block holes.

Sow rule of MAX_SOW: maximum number of seeds a hole may contain

Sow rule of NO_SOW_OPP_NS: don't sow opposite holes with sow_param
seeds

Sow rule of OPP_GETS_OWN_LAST: number of seeds to switch from straight
LAP_CAPT sowing to opponent capturing seeds sown on their side of the
board, unless final seed does capture

<param sow_rule>
Special sow rules add additional behavior or restrictions to the
sowing phase:

- NONE: there is no special sowing rule.

- SOW_BLKD_DIV: If the final seed of an individual sow lands on the
opposite side of the board and brings the contents of that hole to
sow_param seeds, the hole is closed (blocked). In single lap games,
the hole's seeds are removed from play. In multilap games, the seeds
are used to continue sowing.

  + When sowing, blocked holes on your own side of the board are
  skipped and blocked holes on opponent's side are diverted out of
  play or captured.

  +  Game GOAL must be DEPRIVE and all the associated restrictions
  apply. NOCAPTMOVES maybe used to prevent closing holes on the
  initial games moves. Capture mechanisms other than closing holes are
  not supported. The minimum move must be 1 and thus SOW_START is
  incompatible.  ALLOW_RULE may not be used to limit allowable moves.
  SKIP_START is not supported with SOW_BLKD_DIV. MLAPS of LAPPER_NEXT
  is not supported with SOW_BLKD_DIV(_NR).

- SOW_BLKD_DIV_NR: Behaves the same as SOW_BLKD_DIV except that each
player's rightmost hole cannot be closed.

- OWN_SOW_CAPT_ALL: The hole OWNer captures all holes that are sown to
meet the simple capture criteria no matter who sowed them. The simple
capture criteria are evens, min, max and capture on. Other criteria
are enforced: side of the board, unlocked, and not child.

  + The capture is done by the hole owner, so the non-sower may
  capture seeds while their opponent sows. If the game GOAL is
  TERRITORY the capturer is the hole owner; otherwise each player
  captures from their own side of the board no matter who is sowing.

  + If MLAPS is LAPPER and the final seed sown for any lap meets the
  simple capture criteria for that hole, the contents of the hole are
  captured by the sower and not the hole owner and the turn is over.
  For CAPTTWOOUT, CAPT_NEXT and CROSSCAPT captures, the sower always
  does the final capture.

  + GRANDSLAM rules are not applied. NOCAPTMOVES prevents this capture
  for the first moves.

- SOW_CAPT_ALL: Like OWN_SOW_CAPT_ALL but only the SOWer captures
seeds from the side specified by CAPT_SIDE: BOTH sower captures from
any hole. OPP sower capturer only from opponent's holes.  OWN sower
captures only from their own holes.

  + If mlaps is LAPPER and the final seed sown for any lap meets the
  capture criteria, the contents of the hole are captured by the sower
  and not the hole owner and the turn is over.

  + GRANDSLAM rules are not applied. NOCAPTMOVES prevents this capture
  for the first number of specified moves.

- NO_SOW_OPP_NS: Don't sow into opponent's holes with sow_param seeds.

- CHANGE_DIR_LAP: Change the direction for each lap sown. Generally
used with UDIR_HOLES so the player may choose the first direction.

- MAX_SOW: holes sow_param seeds are skipped when sowing. That is,
holes will never contain more seeds than sow_param.

- LAP_CAPT: consider captures on each lap sown (only supported for
MLAPS of LAPPER):

  + If a basic capture is configured (EVENS, CAPT_ON, CAPT_MAX or
  CAPT_MIN), check for capture. It there is a capture, the hole after
  the captured seeds is drawn to continue lapping.

  + If CROSSCAPT is configured and the last seed is sown into empty
  hole, check for cross capture. If there is a capture, continue
  sowing with the single seed.

  + If the CAPT_TYPE is NEXT or TWO_OUT and the last seed of a lap
  ends in an occupied hole, do a possible capture. Then, continue lap
  sowing even if there is no capture.

  + For all LAP_CAPT rules, if stores are not configured, sowing will
  be stopped when the opponent does not have seeds.

- NO_OPP_CHILD: do not sow into your opponent's children.

- LAP_CAPT_OPP_GETS: Use LAP_CAPT sow rule until there are only
sow_param seeds left. Then when down to the last seeds (sow_param or
less at the start of a lap): seeds sown on the opponent's side are
captured by the opponent. If the last seed would do a normal capture,
the sower takes those seeds, including the last seed sown.

- OPP_CHILD_ONLY1: Do not sow opponent's children unless it is with
the final seed of a sow.

- LAP_CAPT_SEEDS: Check for capture on each lap. If a capture occured,
continue sowing with captured seeds and seeds in final hole sown. If
no capture occured, continue if more than one seed is in the final
hole.

  + For all LAP_CAPT rules, if stores are not configured, sowing will
  be stopped when the opponent does not have seeds.

  + Not compatible with basic captures. Behaves badly with most
  capt_types unless other options are used to prevent endless sows.
  Turn on Disallow Endless Sows via the Game menu for experimentation.

- NO_CHILDREN: do not sow any children.

<param sow_start>
When selected, the first seed is sown into (i.e., left in) the start
hole.

<param start_pattern>

Allows specifying non-all-equal start patterns.

For TERRITORY games played in round, <nolink>START_PATTERN is used for
every round, which could yield odd openings--use caution. For round
tally games, the <nolink>START_PATTERN is used for all new games and
rounds. For all other games played in rounds, <nolink>START_PATTERN is
only used for the opening play of a game; not for the start of each
round.

The following patterns are supported:

- ALL_EQUAL: all holes start with the same number of seeds. The total
seeds in play is nbr_start x holes x 2.

- GAMACHA: starting from the third hold (from start player's left)
place nbr_seeds in every other hole, then the center hole's seeds are
moved to the other side of the board. If the board has an even number
of seeds, a near center hole is choosen to move.

  + The gamacha fill pattern is only supported for boards with 3 or
  more holes per side. The total seeds in plays is (holes - 1) x
  nbr_start.

  + <img src="figs/gamacha_patt.jpg" alt="Gamacha Pattern"
  class="helpfig">

- ALTERNATES: every other hole is filled with nbr_seeds, no seeds end
up opposite each other. If a player has fewer seeds than their
opponent, then they start.

  + The total number of seeds in play is holes x nbr_start.

  + <img src="figs/alternates_patt.jpg" alt="Alternates Pattern"
  class="helpfig">

- ALTS_WITH_1: filled like alternates then two changes are made.
First, the seeds of non-starter's second filled hole from the right
are reduced to one seed. Second, for even board sizes, the second
occupied hole from the right on the starter's side is emptied. Both of
these are described from the starter's perspective.

  + The alts_with_1 fill pattern is only supported for boards with 3
  or more holes per side. The total seeds in play is (holes - 1) x
  nbr_start + 1 if holes is odd and (holes - 2) x nbr_start + 1 if
  holes is even.

  + <img src="figs/alts_1_patt.jpg" alt="Alternates with 1 Pattern"
  class="helpfig">

- CLIPPEDTRIPLES: pattern of 0 n n (where n is nbr_seeds) is used to
fill the holes on one side of the board; if a full cycle of 3 cannot
be placed, the holes are left empty. The True and False sides are the
same from the player's perspective, e.g., they will look reversed when
viewed from one side of the game board.

  + The clippedtriples fill pattern is only supported for boards 3 or
  more holes per side. The total seeds in plays is floor(holes / 3) x
  nbr_start x 4.

  + <img src="figs/clipped_triples_patt.jpg" alt="Clipped Triples
  Pattern" class="helpfig">

- TWOEMPTY: all but the rightmost two holes for each player are filled
with is nbr_seeds.

  + The twoempty fill pattern is only supported for boards with 4 or
  more holes per side. The total seeds in play is 2 x (holes - 2) x
  nbr_start.

- RANDOM: The seeds are randomly distributed into the holes. If more
than two seeds per hole are configured, a minimum of two seeds are put
into each hole. Nbr_start is the total number of seeds in play. When
this start pattern is used, the Swap Sides (pie rule) is allowed on
both of the first two moves of the game.

- ALTS_SPLIT: Like alternates but the seeds are reduced in the
rightmost hole of the non-starter. One quarter of the seeds from the
non-starter's rightmost hole are moved across the board into the empty
hole of the starting player.

  + The alts_split fill pattern is only supported for boards with an
  even number of holes per side. The total seeds in play is holes x
  nbr_start.

  + <img src="figs/alts_split_patt.jpg" alt="Clipped Triples Pattern"
  class="helpfig">

- RIGHTMOST_PLUS_ONE: as in ALL_EQUAL but one extra seed is added to
each player's rightmost hole. The total seeds in play is nbr_start x
holes x 2 + 2.

- MOVE_RIGHTMOST: use when the first move of the game must be from the
starter's rightmost hole. This start pattern will perform the opening
move automatically, including any capture or seed removal that should
occur.

- MOVE_RANDOM: a random move is selected and executed. After the move
the turn always changes to the next player; repeat turn is not honored
on this opening random move. This can be used to neutralize the
advantage a game starter might have.

- NO_REPEAT_SOW_OWN: a sow pattern that assures that the starter does
not have a move that will result in a repeat turn as if the game had
SOW_OWN_STORE configured (it is not required).

  + Both sides of the board are setup the same, so the second player
  will only have a repeat turn if the starter's opening move gave them
  one.

  + In broad strokes, an extra seed is placed in the hole whose sow
  would have landed in the store; this seed is taken from a hole such
  that sowing from it will reach one past the store. The actual
  computations vary based on board size and number of start seeds but
  the resulting start pattern will not allow a repeat turn for the
  starter.

  + The seed placement is not adjusted if there is no repeat turn
  possible with an ALL_EQUAL pattern.

- RANDOM_ZEROS: The seeds are randomly distributed into the holes.
Holes may have 0 or >= 4 seeds.  Nbr_start is the total number of
seeds in play. When this start pattern is used, the Swap Sides (pie
rule) is allowed on both of the first two moves of the game.

In the formulas above holes (n in figures) is the game constant HOLES
and nbr_start is the game constant NBR_START.

When a game is played in ROUNDS, start_pattern is only supported for
round tally (RND_*) and territory GOAL games and only for ROUND_FILL
of NOT_APPLICABLE and UCHOWN.

<param stores>
True when stores are present on the game board. For games with GOAL of
DEPRIVE or CLEAR, stores can be used to show whose turn it is (seed
counts will not be sown).

<param mx_stores_m>
The multiplier for the stores scorer. Seeds in stores and children are
included.

The stores scorer may not be used in games without STORES or CHILDREN.
A zero multiplier disables the stores scorer.

Used only for minimax & negamax players.

<param udir_holes>
A list of holes from which the user can choose the sow direction.
Control is via the mouse button: left is clockwise, and right is
counter-clockwise.

Note: all holes respond to both mouse buttons, but if the hole is not
in udir_holes, the sow direction will be that prescribed by sow_direct
with either button.

Games with any hole set to user chooses direction must have GRANDSLAM
be LEGAL and only ALLOW_RULE s that do not depend on sow direction are
supported.

<param unclaimed>
Defines how to score any unclaimed seeds when a game has ended.
Unclaimed seeds are those not in children or stores when a game ends
without a clear winner: no outcome change possible, current player
cannot share, etc.

This parameter is not used for clear, unclaimed or immobilize games.
For other games, this parameter defines how the <a
href="mancala_help.html#gamemenu">Concede Round and Concede Game</a>
menu commands work.

- HOLE_OWNER: unclaimed seeds go to the hole owner.

- DONT_SCORE: unclaimed seeds do not score (they are ignored).

- LAST_MOVER: unclaimed seeds go the player that moved last.

- UNFED_PLAYER: only valid for MUSTSHARE games. If the game ended
without one player being able to share seeds, the seeds go to the
player without seeds (the unfed player).

  + If a Concede/End Round/Game menu command is used to end the game,
  the unclaimed seeds are handled with the QUITTER configuration.

- DIVVIED: the seeds are divided between the two players (an extra
seed goes to the player with fewer seeds).

<param quitter>

Defines how to score any unclaimed seeds when a player ends the round
or game using an <a href="mancala_help.html#gamemenu">End Round or End
Game</a> menu command.

This parameter is not used for clear, deprive or immobilize games.

The allowable values are the same as for UNCLAIMED (EndGameSeeds)
except UNFED_PLAYER is disallowed. <no_enum_error>

<param variants>

Provide a dictionary in JSON format of named variants whose values are
the parameters to set for that variant. The first name of the variant
must match the game name and must have an empty dictionary.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is explained here:
https://www.json.org/json-en.html.

The following value would define a base game of Krur and a named
variant of <nolink>Krur::Rounds which changes the values of four
parameters from the base game:
<pre class="fixed">
{
   "Krur": { },
   "Rounds": {
      "rounds": 2,
      "blocks": true,
      "round_starter": 0,
      "round_fill": 1
   }
}
</pre>

<param vari_params>

Provide a dictionary in JSON format where the keys are paramters
(options) and the associated values are a list valid values for each.
If all values are to be allowed any non-list type can be provided;
"include" or "all" are suggested.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is explained here:
https://www.json.org/json-en.html.

The following value would allow changing of three parameters:
selection of board sizes 3 to 6; mustpass as true or false; and
capturing in the sow direction or the opposite of the sow direction
(but not sowing in both directions):
<pre class="fixed">
{
   "holes": [ 3, 4, 5, 6 ],
   "mustpass": "include",
   "capt_dir": [ 0, 1 ]
}
</pre>

<param xc_sown>
Only allow cross capture if the player has sown onto the opposite side
of board.

If a player ends on their own side of the board in an empty hole, but
did not sow any opposite hole, they get a repeat turn.

<param xcpickown>
When crosscapt is set, it defines what to do with the single seed
initiating the cross capture.

- LEAVE: always leave the single seed

- PICK_ON_CAPT: only pick (capture) the seed if there was a capture

- ALWAYS_PICK: always pick (capture) the final single seed, even if
there was not a capture
