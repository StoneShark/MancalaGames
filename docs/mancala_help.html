<h1>Mancala Games</h1>
<p>Mancala Games is an engine for playing several variants of Mancala.
Games may be played with two players or one player and an
<a href="#aiplayer">AI player</a>.

<p>This engine supports games with two ranks of 2 to 21 holes per side.
Game stores to the left and right of holes are optional.

<h2 id="game_play">Game Play</h2>
<p>Game play generally proceeds in the following steps:

<ol type="I">
<li class="over">Initialize game (or round).
Game initialization distributes the number of start seeds into each hole.
Round initialization distributes the seeds each player has into
their holes, possibly blocking some holes from play for the round.
<li class="over">Play the game.
Players alternate turns performing these steps for each turn:
	<ol type="A">
	<li class="over">Sowing Phase:
		<ol type='1'>
		<li class="over">Current player removes the seeds from one hole
		on their side of the board.
		Depending on the game, only some of the player's holes are available for
		play.
		<li class="over">Those seeds are sown into new holes one at a time:
		clockwise or counter-clockwise.
		Sow direction depends on game parameters, and is occationally
		under user control.
		<li class="over">Optionally, for multi-lap games,
		the seeds in the final hole sown, are picked up and sowing continues.
		<li class="over">Optionally, for store sowing games,
		a seed maybe sown into the player's store when it is being passed.
		</ol>
	<li class="over">Capture Phase:
		<ol type="1">
		<li class="over">The player moves seeds from
		the capture holes to a store, walda or child.
		Holes where seeds are captured are defined by game rules, possibilities include:
		<ul><li>where the final seed landed
		<li>across the board from the final seed sown
		<li>after the final hole sown
		<li>two out or across a gap from the final hole sown
		</ul>
		<li class="over">Some games support multiple captures.
		Game rules specify which direction these capture occur in.
		</ol>
	<li class="over">Determine if there is a winner or other special
	conditions&mdash;such as a required pass or repeat turn.
	</ol>
<li class="over">Check for end game conditions: win, loss, tie or end of round.
</ol>

<h2 id="starting">Selecting and Starting Games</h2>
<p>The Mancala Games Engine provides three ways to start a game.
Game play is always via the <a href="#manwindow">Mancala UI</a>.

<ol>
<li><b>play_mancala</b>:
allows selecting any of the 100+ preconfigured games to play.
The game list is provided and the game overview is displayed. The game list can
be reduced by selecting some high level game properties.
See <a href="#playwindow">Play Mancala</a> (play_mancala.exe).
Control-r selects a random game.
<br><br>
<li><b>man_games_editor</b>: Pops up the game editor&mdash;see
<a href="#opwindow">Mancala Games Editor</a> (man_games_editor.exe).
Game property files can be defined, loaded, edited and saved.
Games can be played with the currently define parameters.
<br><br>
<li><b>play</b>: a command line interface to directly start a game given
a mancala configuration file. Usage to play Wari (for example):
<pre>
     play.exe Wari
</pre>This method can be used to create a shortcut to startup your favorite game.

</ol>

<p>Each of these can also be started directly from the python source
(in the src directory).
Some operating systems support a double click to start the file.
Other would require a command such as:
<pre>
	python play_mancala.pyw
</pre>

<h2 id="manwindow">Mancala UI</h2>

<p>The Mancala Game window represents the playing surface: two ranks of
holes for each player are provided and (if configured) stores are available on
either side. The right store is for the lower player and the left hole
is for the upper player.

<p>The Mancala UI is directly created by the Play command line script;
is created after a game is selected in Play_Mancala;
and is created when the Play button is hit in Man_Games_Editor.

<p>Visual and behavior options of the Mancala UI may be set via a mancala.ini file.
If this file doesn't exist it is created. Comments in the distribution file
describe the options, what they do, and valid values.
Some validation is done when loading the file but errors may still slip through.

<h3>Game Play</h3>
<p>Game moves are made by clicking on the desired hole to start sowing from (the draw).
Sow direction is defined by <a href="game_params.html#sow_direct">SOW_DIRECT</a>
and <a href="game_params.html#udir_holes">UDIR_HOLES</a>.

<p>If udir_holes are not selected,
the sow direction is completely controlled via
<a href="game_params.html#sow_direct">SOW_DIRECT</a>.
For holes configured without UDIR_HOLES,
both the left and right buttons sow in the defined direction.
Clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) apply to all holes.

<p>If SOW_DIRECT is set to SPLIT sow, the left half of the holes sow to the player's left
(CW for the south player and CCW for the north player) and
the right half of holes sow to the player's right
(CCW for the north player and CW for the south player).
If there is an odd number of holes per side, the center hole will follow the SOW_DIRECT
unless it is designated a user directed hole (see below).

<p>Some or all of the holes may be configured to be user controlled sow direction
via <a href="game_params.html#udir_holes">UDIR_HOLES</a>.
For these holes the player chooses the sow direction on each move based on which
mouse button initiates the move:
a left click sows seeds to the player's left and
a right click sows seeds to the player's right.

<p>A Touch Screen option allows the direction of sow to be selected only with
a left clicks. A grid is shown on the 'right' side of the button, selecting
it will perform the right direction sow. The visual properites (color and density)
of the grid may be defined in the mancala.ini file.

<p>All of the rest of the move steps are performed automatically.
If a player is required to pass, a window will popup to state that.

<h3>Special Seed Movement Modes</h3>
<p>Some games involve special seed movement phases either at the
start of the game or between rounds. When in one of these modes
the holes are given a special color.
<p>A right click will pick up seeds and a left click will drop
seeds. When the board is setup as desired hit the "Done" button.
A check will be made to assure that the game rules are not
violated. All seeds must be dropped (placed) somewhere.

<h4>Choose Blocks Behavior</h4>
When the <a href="game_params.html#round_fill">ROUND_FILL</a>
parameter is set to UCHOOSE the looser may choose which holes are blocked
at the start of each round.
Move seeds out of the holes that you wish to be blocked and into
the holes that you do not wish to be blocked.
Seeds may not be moved in or out of the stores.


<h4>Seed Movement for New Round</h4>
<p>When the <a href="game_params.html#round_fill">ROUND_FILL</a>
parameter is set to UMOVE the loser may choose where seeds are placed
on their side of the board at the start of each round.

<p>Any number of seeds may be placed on the board or in the store
with the following restrictions:
<ul>
<li>Each hole must contain at least one seed.
<li>The game must be playable, that is, at least one hole must have
<a href="game_params.html#min_move">min_move</a> seeds.
</ul>
Seeds cannot be moved between sides of the board.
<p>The winner's seeds will be arranged in the same layout
as the loser's side, but will be relected.
The number of seeds per player is not changed, any extra
seeds that the winner had will be placed in their store.


<h4>Move Seeds Turn</h4>
<p>If the game is configured with
<a href="game_params.html#prescribed">PRESCRIBED</a>
as ARNGE_LIMIT, the first player may choose to rearrange the seeds
instead of a normal sow/capture move.
Seed rearragement is the player's turn.

<p>The starting player may arrange the seeds on their side of the board and
the other player's seeds will be arranged in the same order but reflected.
All seeds must be left in play.

<p>If the player doesn't change the seed arrangement,
they are disallowed from capturing or making children
until their opponent has does one of those.

<h4>Seed Movement for New Round</h4>
<p>When the <a href="game_params.html#round_fill">ROUND_FILL</a>
parameter is set to UCHOWN, the owner of holes on the loser side
may be changed. The number of holes owned by each player must
reflect the game state to exit the mode.

<h3>Menus</h3>

<h4 id="gamemenu">Game</h4>
<p><b>New Round</b>: Start a new round of the current game.
An in-progress round is not tallied.
Use this after Wait was used to examine a round.
<p>This command is not available if the game is not played in rounds.

<p><b>New Game</b>: Start a new game. An in-progress game is not tallied.
Use this after Wait was used to examine a round.

<p><b>Concede Round</b>: Concede the current round.
Suggested use is when there is a clear winner to skip a tedious end game.
The round will be scored and a check for end game will be done.

<p>Conceding a clear, deprive and immobilize game awards the win based on
seeds held by each player.
Clear games are awarded to the player with fewer seeds.
Deprive and immobilize games are award to the player with more seeds.

<p>For other games, the
<a href="game_params.html#unclaimed">UNCLAIMED</a> parameter specifies
the handling of seeds not in chilren or stores.

<p>This command is not available if the game is not played in rounds.

<p><b>Concede Game</b>: End the current game and tally the game.

<p>Conceding a clear, deprive and immobilize game awards the win based on
seeds held by each player.
Clear games are awarded to the player with fewer seeds.
Deprive and immobilize games are award to the player with more seeds.

<p>For other games, the
<a href="game_params.html#unclaimed">UNCLAIMED</a> parameter specifies
the handling of seeds not in chilren or stores.

<p><b>End Round</b>: End the current round.
Suggested use is when there are seeds cycling on the board.
The round will be scored and a check for end game will be done.
For clear, deprive and immobilize goal games, the round will be ended in a tie.
For other games, the
<a href="game_params.html#quitter">QUITTER</a> parameter specifies
the handling of seeds not in chilren or stores.
<p>This command is not avaliable if the game is not played in rounds.

<p><b>End Game</b>: End and tally the current game.
Suggested use is when there are seeds cycling on the board.
For clear, deprive and immobilize goal games, the game will be ended in a tie.
For most other games, the
<a href="game_params.html#quitter">QUITTER</a> parameter specifies
the handling of seeds not in chilren or stores.

<p><b>Disallow Endless Sows</b>: Do not allows moves that would be endless
sows. A sow is declared 'endless' at 75 laps.
This command is only supported for games played in
<a href="game_params.html#mlaps">multiple-laps</a>
that do not have <a href="game_params.html#udir_holes">user directed</a> sow directions.

<p><b>Config Variant...</b>: choose new values for the variant parameters.
Changing the variants resets all tally parameters.
There are two kinds of variants available named variants and individual parameters
that can be changed.

<p>The variant commands are not available if the game was not configured to have
variants or if a game started from man_games_editor has been edited since the
last save (i.e., the game configuration must match a saved game configuration file to
use variants in the editor).

<p><b>Variant Settings...</b>: show a popup with the current settings for all
parameters that make up the variants.

<p><b>Revert Variant...</b>: revert the game configuration to the default variant;
the game first loaded by MancalaUI.

<p><b>Setup Board</b>: Enter a game setup mode. The board maybe reconfigured as desired.
The coloring of the board is as though the game is being played, but all buttons maybe
clicked to adjust game conditions.
Touch screen grids are only shown as they would be in game play.
<p>Right clicking on a board hole or store does pickup of seeds,
possibly via a menu option (depending on game configuration).
The cursor is changed to circle if there are any held seeds
and the number of held seeds is shown in the control box.
Left click drops any held seeds.
<p>If there are children, locks, blocks or owners configured, these may also be changed
from the right click menu.
Children are cycled through north, south and none.
Locks, blocks and owners are toggled.
<p>For games with goals DEPRIVE or CLEAR, there is a button in the control panel which
collects seeds that are out of play.
Right click picks seeds up from the out-of-play container.
Left click drops any held seeds into the out-of-play container.
<p>No game rules are checked when in setup mode.
Exiting setup mode requires that there be a valid move for the player to move.

<p><b>Reset to Setup</b>: On exiting setup mode, the game state is saved,
this command allows returning to that saved state.
Suppose, for example, that a puzzle is setup; after trying to solve the puzzle,
this command can be used to return the initial state.

<h4>Move</h4>
<p><b>Undo Move</b>: Undo a previous move. Multiple moves may undone and redone.
Control-z undoes a move. The AI player is not scheduled to move after an undo or redo.
If you want the AI to move on it's turn deactivate and reactivate the AI player.
<p>The length of the undo history can be set in the mancala.ini file via 'history_size'.
<p><b>Redo Move</b>: Redo an undone move. Multiple moves may undone and redone.
Control-Shift-Z redoes a move.
<p>Redoing to the end game state will disable the buttons on the board.

<p><b>Swap Sides</b>: A player may swap sides of the board, that is,
execute a Pie Rule, under two conditions:
<ol>
<li>When the
<a href="game_params.html#start_pattern">START_PATTERN</a>
is random or move_random, either player may choose to swap sides
before their first turn but only one swap may be done per game.
<li>After the first player finishes their turn in a game,
the second player may swap sides, for other games.
</ol>
<p>This is a common way to deal with games that favor the
starting player. Only some Mancala games offer an advantage to the starting player,
but this option is always availble. The AI player will never choose to swap sides.
<p>Swapping sides counts as a move, in terms of any move count parameters
(prescribed sow, no capture move count, etc.).

<h4>Player</h4>
<p><b>AI Player Active</b>: Enable or disable the ai player.
The AI Player plays the top/north row; you play the bottom/south row.
<p>The delay sets an artificial delay between moves (for UI update), but the
actual AI move may still take some based on the difficulty setting.
More specifically, the look ahead distance.
<p><b>No AI Delay</b>: The UI is not updated before the AI plays.
You will not see the available moves for the AI and will not see
updates between repeat turns.
<p><b>Short AI Delay</b>: There is a short delay after your move,
before the AI plays. This allows a brief glance (about 1 second)
at the results of your move and which moves are available for the
AI player. You will see updates between repeat turns.
<p><b>Long AI Delay</b>: Similar to 'Short AI Delay' but the delay
lengthened to about 3 seconds.
<p><b class="inhead">Difficulty Ratings</b> set number of moves the AI player will look ahead
and other effects listed below:
<p><b>Easy</b>: Set the AI difficulty to easy. On the easy setting
the 'Easy Error Random' will be included in minimaxer
<a href="#aiparams">scores</a>. Look ahead is typically 1 move.
<p><b>Normal</b>: Set the AI difficulty to normal.
Look ahead is typically 1 move.
<p><b>Hard</b>: Set the AI difficulty to hard.
The 'Access (d>1) Mult will be included in the scorer.
Look ahead is typically 3 moves.
<p><b>Expert</b>: Set the AI difficulty to hard.
The 'Access (d>1) Mult will be included in the scorer.


<h4>Display</h4>
<p><b>Show Tally Pane</b>: Show or hide the tally frame.
<p><b>Touch Screen</b>: Enable or disable touch screen mode. Touch screen mode
facilitates user selected sow direction without requiring a two-button mouse.
A rectangle is dithered onto any user directed buttons for the right click.
<p><b>Facing Players</b>: Rotate the text for the top player as though two players
are sitting on opposite sides of a screen. When facing players is active, the
left and right mouse button operations are swapped
for the player closest to the menu bar.
Specifically, if facing players is set, a left click will sow counter-clockwise
and a right click will sow clockwise for the player closest to the menu bar.
<p><b>Ownership Arrows</b>: Show the hole ownership arrows.
Colors are used to identify the current players holes, but arrows can also be
shown to show hole ownership in TERRITORY goal games.

<h4>Animator</h4>

<p>Moves can be animated or sequenced to show the steps takens.
Each step is occurs sequentially with a small delay between each.
The delay can be adjusted to control the speed of the animations.

<p>The animator can be completely disabled by setting disable_animator to yes
in the mancala.ini file.

<p>The animation controls will only appear if disable_animator is set to no
in the mancala.ini file.

<p><b>Animation Active</b>: Enable or disable the animations.
Control-a will also toggle animation active.

<p><b>Anim Speed Reset</b>: Reset the animation delay to either a configured value
from the mancala.ini file or (if not set there) the default delay.
The speed can be reset by typing =.

<p><b>Anim Speed Fastest</b>: Set the animator speed to its fastest value.
The speed can be set to faster by typing }.

<p><b>Anim Speed Faster</b>: Increase the speed of the animation steps.
The delay is decreased by 50 ms to a minimum of 50ms.
The speed can be in increased by typing >.

<p><b>Anim Speed Slower</b>: Decrease the speed of the animation steps.
The delay is increased creased by 50 ms.
The speed can be decreased by typing <.

<h4>Log</h4>
<p><b>Live Log</b>: The log is printed to the console as it is collected.
Some information may give away the AI Players intenteded moves.
<p><b>Show Prev</b>: If the game was started from a console window,
this will show a test description of the previous board layout
(if there was one).
<p><b>Show Log</b>: If the game was started from a console window,
show a log of the game moves.
<p><b>Save Log...</b>: Saves the log to the logs directory with a
date and time stamp.
<p>The current <b class="inhead">Log Level</b> controls what is added to the game log,
each log level includes the items from the level above it:
<ol>
<li><b>Moves</b>: Records each move and a description for ai moves.
<li><b>Important</b>: Records important actions or prohibitions
which describe behavior that might appear as incorrect, but are part of the game rules.
<li><b>Steps</b>: Adds a description of each game step to the log.
<li><b>Information</b>: Adds game progress information to the log.
These items are generally apparent to the players, but this creates a record.
<li><b>Detail</b>: Includes very detailed information in the game log,
e.g. individual sowing substeps in multilap games.
</ol>
<p><b>Filter AI Scores</b>: Don't show the scores that the AI uses to pick moves.
On by default, not supported from ini file.
<p><b>Log AI Analysis</b>: Turn on logging for the AI Player's analysis of moves.
This can become quite verbose as the AI player considers each possible move and response.

<h4>Help</h4>
<p><b>Help...</b>: Open the game descriptions help file.
Tag (hash id) might be ignored (depends on your operating system configuration);
use the Game Index to find the game's help section.
<p><b>About Game...</b>: Popup the game about description, this displays any text
that was included in the About pane of the Mancala Games Editor window.
<p><b>About...</b>: Popup the about copyright and version information.

<h2 id="playwindow">Play Mancala - Game Chooser</h2>

<p>Play Mancala allows playing any of the provided game configurations.
Adjusting parameters is not supported.

<p>Selecting a game from the Game List will show it's overview
and configured parameters.
When a game is selected,
the Play button will startup the <a href="#manwindow">Mancala UI</a>
to allow playing the game.

<p>The Game List can be navigated with home, end, page up and down, up and down arrow,
and hitting a keyboard key will cycle through the games in the list that start
with that letter.

<p>The list of games shown can be filtered based on game configuration
parameters. There are two types of filter categories: filters that divide the game list into
non-overlapping sets and feature filters.
A game must be selected by all filter categories to be included in the list.
The filter types are described in seperate sections below.

<p>Game log entries are collected according to the Log menu settings in the Mancala UI,
but Live Log is not supported when the Mancala UI is started from play_mancala.exe.
Logs may be saved during or at the end of each game.
If play_mancala.py is run directly via the python command from a console
window, Live Log is supported.

<p>Warning: the main Play Manacala window is left active while the game is
being played. Starting a second game is not recommended (there are a small number
of global variables).

<h3>Non-overlapping Filters</h3>
<p>The non-overlapping sets filters include:
<ul><li>Game <a href="game_params.html#game_class">Class</a>
<li>Board Size (<a href="game_params.html#holes">holes</a> per side)
<li>Game <a href="game_params.html#goal">Goal</a>
<li>AI <a href="game_params.html#algorithm">Algorithm</a> Configured
<li><a href="game_params.html#mlaps">Lap type</a>
<li>Special <a href="game_params.html#sow_rule">Sow Rule</a> (in groups)
<li>Sow Direction (based on both <a href="game_params.html#sow_direct">sow_direct</a>
<li><a href="game_params.html#child_type">Child Type</a>
and <a href="game_params.html#udir_holes">udir_holes</a>)
<li>Capture Type, groups are defined using:
<ul>
<li>Basic capture:
<a href="game_params.html#capt_max">maximum</a>,
<a href="game_params.html#capt_min">minimum</a>,
<a href="game_params.html#capt_on">capture on values</a>, or
<a href="game_params.html#evens">evens</a>
without either of the next two properties
<li><a href="game_params.html#crosscapt">Cross capture</a>
<li>Capture Type set: <a href="game_params.html#capt_type">capt_type</a>
is not NONE
<li>Other (none of the groups above but they have
<a href="game_params.html#presowcapt">pre-sow capture</a>,
<a href="game_params.html#child_type">children</a>, or
<a href="game_params.html#sow_own_store">sow own store</a> configured)</ul></ul>
Each checkbox within these filter categories
determines if games with that property are shown.
A game with any filled checkbox will be included in the game list.
Choosing All will set all the options in the category
and show all the games not filtered by another category.
Choosing None will clear all the options in the filter category
and the games.

<h3>Feature Filters</H3>
<p>The features filters do not break the game list into non-overlapping sets.
Each checkbox within these features describes a property of the game defined by
one or more parameter settings. These checkboxes have three states,
clicking on the property cycles the selection:
<ul><li>Filled: only show games with the property.
<li>Unfilled: only show games without the property.
<li>X: don't filter on the property, show games regardless of the setting for this
property (somes this is called a "don't care" setting).
</ul>

<p>For the feature categories, only games that match all properties are shown.
Experiment with the features and review the parameter lists to see what
each feature filter includes.

<p>The All button sets the properties to "don't care" (so all games will be included)
and the None button clears all the properties (so only games with all of the
listed features turned off will be shown).
Setting all of the features to selected (filled) will clear the game list
(no game includes all of the features, in fact, must share and must pass are
prohibited together).

<p>Feature filters are in two groups: Configuration and Features.
Configuration options filter on properties of the game configuration file.
Feature options filter on how a game plays.

<h2 id="opwindow">Mancala Games Editor</h2>

<p>Mancala Games Editor allows editing all game options and select game rules.
It is started via the man_games_editor python file or executable.

<p>While all options can be set via Mancala Games,
Some combinations of parameters are not implemented (NotImplementedError generated)
or prohibited (GameInfoError reported).
Other combinations are not recommended and either generate
an actual warning (UserWarning) or
a 'gentle warning' (a print to the console--if there is one).

<p>After selecting the desired options the Command Buttons are used
to test, load, save, and launch the game.

<h3>Command Buttons</h3>
<p>Command buttons appear across the bottom of the main window.
<h4>Test</h4>
<p>The test button checks the consistency of the selected options
generating both warnings and errors.
Warnings suggest that there might be odd game play, but you can proceed if you want.
Errors mean that the game cannot be played with the options that you've selected.
<h4>Load</h4>
<p>The load button loads a saved game configuration.
Several game configurations are provided and you can create your own.
They are described in <a href="about_games.html">Mancala Game Configurations</a>.
<p>The parameters are loaded and then checked for issues.
Some errors will be correctable directly in the UI,
others (created by editing the JSON file) may require
going back to your text editor.
<h4>Save</h4>
<p>The save button saves the current options to a file.
User save files will be larger than the provided
games because all options are written to the file.
The JSON text files which may be edited directly.
See <a href="game_params.html">Mancala Game Parameters</a>.
<h4>Play</h4>
<p>The play button launches the Mancala Game window allowing
a game to be played with the current options.
If the selected options have not been tested or
have been changed since the last test, they are tested before the
game is started.
<p>During game play all parameter entry is disabled, but left
visible to allow review of the options.

<h2 id="aiplayer">AI Player</h2>
<p>Several AI Player algorithms are supported: minimaxer, negamaxer and monte carlo tree search.

<h3>Minimaxer</h3>
<p>The goal of minimax is to minimize the maximum possible loss,
that is search for a move that minimizes your opponents best possible
move in response to each of your best moves.
<p>Minimaxing is commonly used for two-player zero-sum games.
Zero-sum games are those where one player must lose for the other player to win.
The approach used here requires that the game state be statically
evaluated after each simulated move, that is a numeric goodness score.
Statically means the AI only looks at the results of each move sequence,
complex planning is not done.
<p>The method evaluates a specified number of moves into the future.
This searching involves examining each of the AI moves against the players
moves. The philosophy is that the greater the search depth,
the better the selected move.
There is a trade off the greater the search depth, the longer it takes to
select the next move.

<h3>Negamaxer</h3>
<p>The negamaxer algorithm is an optimization of the minimaxer
algorithm. It can only be used for games with strictly alternating turns
(no repeat turns or 2nd turn phase).
<p>The optimization takes advantage of the alternating turns and is able
to simplify the math.

<h3>Monte Carlo Tree Search</h3>
<p>The Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm uses random game play to determine
the quality game moves.
This quality is computed based on the final game outcomes.
This is a key advantage to MCTS because games states do not need to be
statically evaluated based on <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the game.

<ol>
<li class="spaced">Expand the game tree from the
<b class="inhead">current-game-node</b> by mcts_nodes.
At each iteration, this expansion adds an unexplored
<b class="inhead">game-node</b> to the game tree.
The expasion tends towards the best moves, but also uses mcts_bias to spread the search.
Steps 2 and 3 are done for each expansion.
<li class="spaced">From this new, unexplored <b class="inhead">game-node</b>,
play out mcts_pouts games.
Random moves are selected for this playout.
When the game simulation is completed a concrete reward is known for the
choices made.
<li>Backpropagate the reward from those play outs from the expanded
<b class="inhead">game-node</b> up to current-game-node.
<li class="spaced">Select the best node from the <b class="inhead">current-game-node</b>,
given the new information.
The bias is not used in this selection--the best move (based on data collected so far)
will be choosen.
</ol>

<p>Several parameters control how the game tree is expanded and searched:

<ul>
<li class="spaced"><b><a href="game_params.html#mcts_nodes">MCTS_NODES</a></b>:
defines how many nodes are added to the game tree on each turn.
<li class="spaced"><b><a href="game_params.html#mcts_pouts">MCTS_POUTS</a></b>:
defines how many games are played out from each of the new nodes added to the game tree.
The result of these play outs, are used for the score (reward) for the node played out.
<li class="spaced"><b><a href="game_params.html#mcts_bias">MCTS_BIAS</a></b>:
defines how likely we are to explore the game tree,
instead of focusing only on the best paths found so far.
Without this exploration the player might never find the overall best path
(i.e. it would get stuck in local maxima).
</ul>

<h3 id="aiparams">Minimaxer/Negamaxer Evaluation Multipliers</h3>
<p>The Minimaxer and Negamaxer statically evaluate
each game state after each simulated move.
Game properties are collected for a given game state and
multipliers are applied to determine the state's score.
For example, the number of empty holes each player has is
numerical property. The available properties are predetermined,
but the multipliers are selectable parameters defined in the game configuration
or adjusted with via <a href="#opwindow">Mancala Games Editor</a>.
The parameters are described in
<a href="game_params.html#tab_Player">Mancala Parameters</a>
page under Player Tab.

<p>The multipliers are applied to a difference of each players statistic.
For example, the number of seeds the AI player has are
subtracted from the human players seeds and then the multiplier is
applied
(<a href="game_params.html#mx_seeds_m">MX_SEEDS_M</a>):
<p class="center">(&#931; (Human seeds) - &#931; (AI seeds)) * mx_seeds_m
<p>thus the multipler can be used to either maximize or minimize the
statistic.
Positive multipliers maximize it and negative multipliers will minimize it
from the perspective of the AI player.
<p>The multipliers set the relative importance of each factor in evaluating
the state of the board; higher absolute values are more important.
<p>The score for each board is the sum of the statistic difference times its multiplier:
<p class="center">score = easy_error + &#931; ((Player_Stat - AI_Stat) * multiplier)
<p>Easy_error is a random number in the range
negative <a href="game_params.html#mx_easy_rand_a">MX_EASY_RAND_A</a> to MX_EASY_RAND_A and
only used when the game difficulty is easy. The purpose is to introduce random errors
to make the AI player make mistakes.

<p>For
<a href="game_params.html#mx_evens_m">MX_EVENS_M</a>,
<a href="game_params.html#mx_seeds_m">MX_SEEDS_M</a>, and
<a href="game_params.html#mx_seeds_m">MX_EMPTIES_M</a>, the multipliers are applied
to game properties in slighly different
ways based on the game configuration:
<ul><li>In games with NO_SIDES, multipliers are applied to the total
count of the properties.
<li>In games with a goal of TERRITORY, the properties are computed by hole owner.
Then the multiplier is applied to the human - ai player parameter.
<li>In all other games, the properties are computed by the side of the board
and the multiplier is applied to the human - ai player parameter.
</ul>

<h2 id="pregames">Preconfigured Games</h2>
<p>Mancala game names vary widely.
One name may have different rule sets or one rule set may have
different names to different people and regions.
<b><i>Liberties have been taken to distinctly identify all games provided.</i></b>
If your favorite game is misnamed, change the file and game names.
<p>See <a href="about_games.html">Mancala Game Configurations</a>
for an overview of all preconfigured games.

<h2 id="fileformat">Game Definition File Format</h2>
Each game is described in a parameter file that is a JSON string.
These are text files that can be loaded, changed and saved with the Mancala Games Editor.
They may also be edited with any text editor.
The JSON parser attempts to provide useful information about any errors found.
<p>There are four required top level elements:
    <ol>
    <li><b class="inhead">game_class</b>:
    A single value is required&mdash;the
    name of python game class.
    <li><b class="inhead">game_constants</b>:
    The value is a JSON string with two required
    key-value pairs: holes and nbr_start.
    No other elements are supported.
    <li><b class="inhead">game_info</b>:
    The value is a JSON string with potentially many
    parameters in key-value pairs.
    Most parameters that control game play are
    defined in this element.
    <li><b class="inhead">player</b>:
    The value is a JSON string describing how the AI player
    should operate for the game.
    See <a href="mancala_help.html#aiplayer">AI Player</a> for more details.
    </ol>
<p>There are two optional top level elements that describe in-game selectable
variations. These are available from the Game menu.
These must be edited directly into the configuration file via a text editor.

<p>Variants allow grouping parameter changes together, e.g., holes and start seeds
should change together in specific ways. Vari_params allows limiting individual parameter
to specific values or changing to any value associated with its type.

	<ol>
	<li><b class="inhead">variants</b>: the value is a JSON string that contains
	a list of pairs of variation_name and param_dicts. The variation name can be
	any valid JSON tag.
	<p>The param_dicts is a JSON string of	parameter name and value pairs.
	These values will always be applied to the base game configuration as specified
	in the file (not those currently being played).
	<p>The first option provided should name the default as in the game
	configuration file and have an empty JSON string { }.
	<li><b class="inhead">vari_params</b>: the value is a JSON string of
	parameter and options. The options should be either a list of options
	or somthing other than a list.
	If options is a list, it must include the option selected by the
	main game configuration.
	When the value is not a list, the defined type of the parameter will be
	used to allow selection of any valid value.
	</ol>
	<p>Other top level elements may be included as notes or documentation.
The same tag-value format required of JSON must be used.
For example, most files have a "rules" tag with a value describing
where rules referenced for the implementation.
This is not the only source of rules for the game,
but are the rules the game was implemented to.
<p>There is game property file "_all_params.txt" that shows where all
game parameters should be placed.
When defining new game files, parameters only need to be specified if the
value is not the default value.
<p>See <a href="game_params.html">Game Parameters</a> for a detailed
description of every game parameter.
<h2 id="anagames">Analysis of Games</h2>
<p>Several scripts are provided to analyze mancala games:
<ul>
<li><b>challange.py</b>: two player configurations can play multple games.
Logs may be collected. A win percentage is reported for the top player.
<li><b>fair_games.py</b>: Uses hypothesis testing to determine if games are likely fair.
Considers both false against true and game starter against non-starter.
<li><b>optimize.py</b>: searches for improve AI configuration parameters.
<li><b>vary_param.py</b>: another tool to support selection of AI configuration
parameters. One parameter is varied through a range of values and games are
played to determine which is stronger.
<li><b>man_profile.py</b>: a software timing and analysis tool for mancala games.
Several predefined actions may be profiled or timed: AI player picking a move,
computing allowable moves, play a game, and random moves.
</ul>
<p>A common player configuration approach and a script to play games
without a UI is provided.
<p>Use the --help option for details on any of the scripts.
