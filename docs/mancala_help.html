<h1>Mancala Games</h1>
<p>Mancala Games is an engine for playing several variants of Mancala.
Games may be played with two players or one player and an
<a href="#aiplayer">AI player</a>.

<p>This engine supports games with two ranks of 2 to 12 holes per side.
Game stores to the left and right of holes are optional.

<h2>Game Play</h2>
<p>Game play proceeds in the following steps:

<ol type="I">
<li class="over">Initialize game (or round).
Game initialization distributes the number of start seeds into each hole.
Round initialization distributes the seeds each player has into
their holes, possibly blocking some holes from play for the round.
<li class="over">Play the game.
Players alternate turns performing these steps for each turn:
	<ol type="A">
	<li class="over">Sowing Phase:
		<ol type='1'>
		<li class="over">Current player removes the seeds from one hole
		on their side of the board.
		Depending on the game, only some of the players holes are available for
		play.
		<li class="over">Those seeds are sown into new holes one at a time:
		clockwise or counter-clockwise.
		Sow direction depends on game parameters, and is occationally
		under user control.
		<li class="over">Optionally, for multi-lap games,
		the seeds in the final hole sown are picked up sowing continues.
		<li class="over">Optionally, for store sowing games,
		a seed maybe sown into the players store when it is being passed.
		</ol>
	<li class="over">Capture Phase:
		<ol type="1">
		<li class="over">The player moves seeds from
		prescribed holes to a store, walda, or child.
		Prescription of holes is parametrically controlled via the
		<a href="#opwindow">Mancala Options UI</a>.
		<li class="over">Some games support multiple captures.
		</ol>
	<li class="over">Determine if there was a winner or other special
	conditions (such as a required pass).
	</ol>
<li class="over">Check for end game conditions: win, loss, tie or end of round.
</ol>

<h2>Selecting and Starting Games</h2>
<p>The Mancala Games Engine provides three ways to start a game.
Game play is always via the <a href="#manwindow">Mancala UI</a>.

<ol>
<li><b>Mancala Games</b>: Pops up the full parameter selection
window&mdash;see <a href="#opwindow">Mancala Options UI</a>.
Game property files can be defined, loaded, edited and saved.
Games can be played with the currently define parameters.
<br><br>
<li><b>Play Mancala</b>: a game that can be started via a double click on
the game link (play_mancala.exe). A popup is provided which allows selection
of any game in the GameProps directory. A tool tip is used to show
the About string of each game.
<br><br>
<li><b>Play</b>: a command line interface to directly start a game given
a mancala configuration file. Usage to play Wari (for example):
<pre>
     play.exe.lnk Wari
</pre>This method can be used to create a shortcut to startup your favorite game.

</ol>

<h2 id="manwindow">Mancala UI</h2>

<p>The Mancala Game window represents the playing surface: two ranks of
holes for each player are provided and(if configured) stores are available on
either side. The right store is for the lower player and the left hole
is for the upper player.
<p><b>Moves:</b> Mouse clicks on the main UI game holes inititiates a sow.
If the sew direction is clockwise (CW), counter-clockwise (CCW) or
split, a left click determines which hole a move starts from.
On split sow, the left half of the holes sow to the player's left
(CW for lower and CCW for upper) and
the right half of holes sow to the player's right  (CCW for lower and CW for upper).
For user directed holes, (udir_holes) a left click moves seeds to the
players left  and a right click sows seeds to the player's right
(in the CW/CCW manner as for split sow).

<p>All of the rest of the move steps are performed automatically.
If a player is required to pass, a window will popup to state that.

<h3>Menus</h3>

<h4>Game</h4>
<p><b>New</b>: Start a new game.
<p><b>End Game</b>: End the current game in as fair a way as possible.
This is useful when the game has reached a stalemate, e.g. two seeds
circling the game board.
Generally, any seeds remaining in play are distributed evenly
with a final odd seed going to the player with the fewer seeds.


<h4>AI</h4>
<p><b>AI Player</b>: Enable or disable the ai player.
The AI Player plays the top row; you play the bottom row.
<p>The delay sets an artificial delay between moves (for UI update), but the
actual AI move may still take some based on the difficulty setting.
More specifically, the look ahead distance.
<p><b>No AI Delay</b>: The UI is not updated before the AI plays.
You will not see the available moves for the AI and will not see
updates between repeat turns.
<p><b>Short AI Delay</b>: There is a short delay after your move,
before the AI plays. This allows a brief glance (about 1 second)
at the results of your move and which moves are available for the
AI player You will see updates between repeat turns.
<p><b>Long AI Delay</b>: Similar to 'Short AI Delay' but the delay
lengthened to about 3 seconds.
<p><b class="inhead">Difficulty Ratings</b> set number of moves the AI player will look ahead
and other effects listed below:
<p><b>Easy</b>: Set the AI difficulty to easy. On the easy setting
the 'Easy Error Random' will be included in minimaxer
<a href="#aiscorer">scores</a>. Look ahead is typically 1 move.
<p><b>Normal</b>: Set the AI difficulty to normal.
Look ahead is typically 1 move.
<p><b>Hard</b>: Set the AI difficulty to hard.
The 'Access (d>1) Mult will be included in the scorer.
Look ahead is typically 3 moves.
<p><b>Expert</b>: Set the AI difficulty to hard.
The 'Access (d>1) Mult will be included in the scorer.
Look ahead is typically 5 moves.

<h4>Log</h4>
<p><b>Show Prev</b>: If the game was started from a console window,
this will show a test description of the previous board layout
(if there was one).
<p><b>Show Log</b>: If the game was started from a console window,
show a log of the game moves.
<p><b>Save Log</b>: Saves the log to the logs directory with a
date and time stamp.

<p>The current <b class="inhead">Log Level</b> controls what is added to the game log,
each log level includes the items from the level above it:
<ol>
<li><b>Moves</b>: Records each move and a description for ai moves.
<li><b>Important</b>: Records important actions or prohibitions
which describe behavior that might appear as incorrect, but are part of the game rules.
<li><b>Steps</b>: Adds a description of each game step to the log.
<li><b>Information</b>: Adds game progress information to the log.
These items are generally apparent to the players, but this creates a record.
<li><b>Detail/All</b>: Includes very detailed information in the game log,
e.g. individual sowing substeps in multilap games.
</ol>

<p>Two additional <b class="inhead">Log Controls</b> are provided:
<p><b>Live Log</b>: The log is printed to the console as it is collected.
Some information may give away the AI Players intenteded moves.
<p><b>Log AI Analysis</b>: Turn on logging for the AI Player's analysis of moves.
This can become quite verbose as the AI player considers each possible move and response.


<h4>Help</h4>
<p><b>Help...</b>: If there is a help file for the game,
popit up in the system browser.
<p><b>About...</b>: Popup the about text, this display any text
that was included in the About pane of the Mancala Options window.


<h2 id="opwindow">Mancala Options UI</h2>

<p>The Mancala Options user interface allows selecting
values for the game options.
Some options are incompatible with each other, errors and inconsistencies
are caught during parameter test.
Some combinations are simply not yet supported (or may never be supported).

After selecting the desired options the Command Buttons are used
to test, load, save, and launch the game.

<h3>Command Buttons</h3>
<p>Command buttons appear across the bottom of the main window.
<h4>Test</h4>
<p>The test button checks the consistency of the selected options
generating both warnings and errors.
Warnings suggest that there might be odd game play, but you can proceed if you want.
Errors mean that the game cannot be played with the options that you've selected.
<h4>Load</h4>
<p>The load button loads a saved game configuration.
Several game configurations are provided and you can create your own.
They are described in <a href="about_games.html">Mancala Game Configurations</a>.
<p>The parameters are loaded and then checked for issues.
Some errors will be correctable directly in the UI,
others (created by editing the JSON file) may require
going back to your text editor.
<h4>Save</h4>
<p>The save button saves the current options to a file.
User save files will be larger than the provided
games because all options are written to the file.
The JSON text files which may be edited directly.
See <a href="game_params.html">Mancala Game Parameters</a>.
<h4>Play</h4>
<p>The play button launches the Mancala Game window allowing
a game to be played with the current options.
If the selected options have not been tested or
have been changed since the last test, they are tested before the
game is started.
<p>During game play all parameter entry is disabled, but left
visible to allow review of the options.

<h2 id="aiplayer">AI Player</h2>
<p>The AI player uses a clever algorithm that's been around since the 1920s
called minimax.
<h3>MiniMaxing</h3>
<p>The goal of minimax is to minimize the maximum possible loss,
that is search for a move that minimizes your opponents best possible
move in response to each of your best moves.
<p>Minimaxing is commonly used for two-player zero-sum games.
Zero-sum games are those where one player must lose for the other player to win.
The approach used here requires that the game state be statically
evaluated after each simulated move, that is a numeric goodness score.
Statically means the AI only looks at the results of each move sequence,
complex planning is not done.
<p>The method evaluates a specified number of moves into the future.
This searching involves examining each of the AI moves against the players
moves. The philosophy is that the greater the search depth,
the better the selected move.
There is a trade off the greater the search depth, the longer it takes to
select the next move.

<h3 id="aiparams">AI Player Params</h3>
<p>The AI Player parameters control how the AI player evaluates the
game after each simulated move.
Negative (or low) values are good for the AI moves.
Positive (or high) values are good for the player.
<p>The multipliers are applied to a difference of each players statistic.
For example, the number of seeds the AI player has are
subtracted from the human players seeds and then the multiplier is
applied:
<p class="center">(&#931; (Human seeds) - &#931; (AI seeds)) * seeds_m
<p>thus the multipler can be used to either maximize or minimize the
statistic.
Positive multipliers maximize it and negative multipliers will minimize it.
<p>The multipliers set the relative importance of each factor in evaluating
the state of the board; higher absolute values are more important.
The UI imposes limits the range of values that
can be selected, but any integer can be set directly in the config file.
<p>The score for each board is the sum of the statistic difference times its multiplier:
<p class="center">score = Easy_Error + &#931; ((Player_Stat - AI_Stat) * multiplier)
<p>The parameters effecting the AI player are shown in the
<a href="game_params.html#tab_Player">Mancala Game Parameters</a> table.


<h2 id="pregames">Preconfigured Games</h2>
<p>Mancala game names vary widely.
One name may have different rule sets or one rule set may have
different names to different people and regions.
<b><i>Liberties have been taken to distinctly identify all games provided.</i></b>
If your favorite game is misnamed, change the file and game names.
<p>See <a href="about_games.html">Mancala Game Configurations</a>
for an overview of all preconfigured games.

<h2>Game Definition File Format</h2>
Each game is described in a parameter file that is a JSON string.
These are text files that can be loaded, changed and saved with the Mancala Options UI.
They may also be edited with any text editor.
The JSON parser attempts to provide useful information about any errors found.
<p>There are four required top level elements:
    <ol>
    <li><b class="inhead">game_class</b>:
    A single value is required$emdash;the
    name of python game class.  Currently only Mancala exists.
    <li><b class="inhead">game_constants</b>:
    The value is a JSON string with two required
    key-value pairs: holes nad nbr_start.
    No other elements are supported.
    <li><b class="inhead">game_info</b>:
    The value is a JSON string with potentially many
    parameters in key-value pairs.
    Most parameters that control game play are
    defined in this element.
    <li><b class="inhead">player</b>:
    The value is a JSON string describing how the AI player
    should operate for the game.
    See <a href="mancala_help.html#aiplayer">AI Player</a> for more details.
    </ol>
<p>There is game property file "all_params.txt" that shows where all
game parameters should be placed.
When defining new game files, parameters only need be specified if the
value is not the default value.
<p>See <a href="game_params.html">Game Parameters</a> for a detailed
description of every game parameter.
