<h1>Mancala Game Parameters</h1>
<p>Game options are provided in the following categories
(presented on corresponding tabs on the Mancala Options UI):
<ul>
<li><a href="#tab_Game"><b class="inhead">Game</b></a>:
Provide high level information about a game: name, description,
size, setup, etc.
<li><a href="#tab_Dynamics"><b class="inhead">Dynamics</b></a>:
Parameters that provide some high level of control over how
game play is conducted and control which holes moves may be started from.
<li><a href="#tab_Sow"><b class="inhead">Sow</b></a>:
Parameters that control how the seeds are sown (moved around)
in the sow phase of a turn including the child parameters.
<li><a href="#tab_Capture"><b class="inhead">Capture</b></a>:
Parameters that control where seeds are captured from and
any special mechanisms for multiple captures.
<li><a href="#tab_Player"><b class="inhead">Player</b></a>:
Selection of the AI player and
parameters that control how it selects moves
(see <a href="mancala_help.html#aiplayer"><b class="inhead">AI Player</b></a>).
</ul>
<p>An alphabetical parameter <a href="#index">index</a>
is included after the parameter sections.

<p>Each parameter description includes:
    <ul>
    <li>Location in Config File to describe where
    the parameter is defined in a Game Description file. The _all_params.txt
    file shows all game options and their default values.
    <li>Type of the parameter with a link to the Parameter Types help.
    <li>The default value for the parameter.
    If the default value is to be used the key-value pair is not needed
    in the game description file.
    Note that Mancala Options UI has slightly different
    defaults to yield a playable game.
    <li>The Mancala Options UI tab on which the parameter can be set.
    </ul>

<ul><li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">Mancala</b>
<p class="helptext"> Allows setting all parameters.
<p class="helptext"> Some combinations of parameters are not implemented (NotImplementedError generated) or prohibited (GameInfoError reported). Other combinations are not recommended and either generate an actual warning (UserWarning) or a 'gentle warning' (a print to the console--if there is one).
<p class="helptext"> Most preconfigured games use this class.
<li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">NorthSouthCycle</b>
<p class="helptext"> A two-cycle game class in which each player only sows on their own side of the board. If <a href="game_params.html#no_sides">NO_SIDES</a> is configured, either player may sow on either side of the board, but the seeds will remain on that side of the board.
<p class="helptext"> Players may effect eachother's play with <a href="game_params.html#crosscapt">CROSSCAPT</a>, <a href="game_params.html#pickextra">PICKEXTRA</a>, Qur <a href="game_params.html#child_type">CHILD_TYPE</a>, and others. 
<p class="helptext"> <a href="about_games.html#Weg">Weg</a> children are only supported for no_sides games.

<li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">EastWestCycle</b>
<p class="helptext"> A two-cycle game class in which player's control east and west sides of the board, and seeds are sown in those cycles.
<p class="helptext"> Without specialized extension of this game class, it appears to only support race type games, e.g. who can clear their holes faster. Their is little or no player interaction supported.
<li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">BearOff</b>
<p class="helptext"> A game class that does Backgammon-like bear off board clearing after the game reaches a state where only singletons are left. When a sow reaches the player's end of the board, any remaining seeds in hand are removed from play (actually moved to their store).
<p class="helptext"> This is intendend for clear and deprive games, though this is not enforced. It turns the end game into a race to see which player accomplishes the goal first.
<p class="helptext"> The transition from normal sow to bear-off sowing is made on the first move when all of the seeds on the board are singletons (i.e., all holes <=1 seeds). Games may ended via an outright win before this condition is achieved.
<p class="helptext"> Even if a future moves starts with > 1 seeds in a hole, the normal sow is not resumed.
<p class="helptext"> <a href="about_games.html#Andada">Andada</a> is a preconfigured game usinging this class.
<li class="helptext">
<a href="about_games.html#Diffusion">Diffusion</a> (also a game)
<p class="helptext"> A game class with has a unique sow method and win condition. Players control the east/west sides of the board.
<p class="helptext"> The game is basically preconfigured, only the board size can be changed to any even size. Game goal must be CLEAR.
<li class="helptext">
<a href="about_games.html#DiffusionV2">DiffusionV2</a> (also a game)
<p class="helptext"> Like <nolink>Diffusion but players control the typical north/south sides of the board.
<li class="helptext">
<a href="about_games.html#SameSide">SameSide</a>  (also a game)
<p class="helptext"> A game class in which seeds are only sown on the player's own side of the board. If a capture is made, the capturer chooses one of their opponent's holes to put the seeds into. All seeds go into exactly one hole.
<p class="helptext">  The game goal must be CLEAR. Sow direction is unconstrained. Capture mechanisms must be limited to one side of the board: basic captures, next, and two out.
<li class="helptext">
<a href="about_games.html#Ohojichi">Ohojichi</a>  (also a game)
<p class="helptext"> A <nolink>SameSide game but the board is divided east/west instead of north/south. Most parameter restrictions from <nolink>SameSide apply to <nolink>Ohojichi. For <nolink>Ohojichi, if <a href="game_params.html#udir_holes">UDIR_HOLES</a> is used, all holes must be UDIR; capture side must be BOTH.

<p id="Goal" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#Goal"> Goal </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Dynamics

<p>The overall goal of the game. Defines how a player wins.
<ol start=0><li class="helptext">
<b class="enum">MAX_SEEDS</b>: The goal is to collect the maximum number of seeds.
<p class="helptext"> If the game is not played in rounds, the game will end when one player has more than half of the total seeds.
<p class="helptext"> If the game is played in rounds, the round end condition is decided by <a href="game_params.html#rounds">ROUNDS</a>. These games end when one player has collected sufficient seeds to prevent the opponent from filling the required number of holes. Generally, the required number of holes is one, but this may be increased by setting goal_param. 
<p class="helptext"> In MAX_SEEDS/ROUNDS games the player only controls the holes on their side of the board, while, in TERRITORY games a player may control holes on either side of the board.
<li class="helptext">
<b class="enum">DEPRIVE</b>: eliminate all your opponent's seeds.
<p class="helptext"> If a player has no seeds at the start of their turn, they lose. If a player has no moves at the start of their turn, then the game outcome is decided by who has seeds: If both players have seeds, the game ends in a tie. If the current player has seeds, but the previous player does not, then the current player wins because they forced the previous player to give away all their seeds.
<p class="helptext"> <a href="game_params.html#grandslam">GRANDSLAM</a> must be legal for DEPRIVE games.
<p class="helptext"> DEPRIVE games cannot be played in <a href="game_params.html#rounds">ROUNDS</a> or use children. Additionally, the following options are incompatible with DEPRIVE games: <a href="game_params.html#moveunlock">MOVEUNLOCK</a>, <a href="game_params.html#mustpass">MUSTPASS</a> and <a href="game_params.html#mustshare">MUSTSHARE</a>.
<li class="helptext">
<b class="enum">TERRITORY</b>: claim ownership of holes by collecting more seeds than your opponent. Claiming ownership of goal_param holes wins the game.
<p class="helptext"> Territory games are generally played in rounds. A winner is declared for each round based on the condition set in <a href="game_params.html#rounds">ROUNDS</a>.
<p class="helptext"> After each round, the ownership of holes is decided by the number of seeds captured in the previous round. The winner's collected seeds are used to fill as many holes as they can with <a href="game_params.html#nbr_start">NBR_START</a> seeds, first on their own side of the board and then their opponent's side.  Next, if they have more than half the seeds required to fill another hole, ownership of one more hole is allocated to them. The remaining holes are allocated to the round loser. 
<p class="helptext"> This ownership of holes only applies to the next round played; ownership of holes varies with each round played. Hole ownership may be reclaimed or lost each round.
<p class="helptext"> The Ownership Arrows Display option may be used to show hole ownership with long thin arrows in each hole. The arrows point up for the top player and down for the bottom player. If facing players is set, the arrows point towards the hole owner.
<p class="helptext"> A move maybe started from any hole owned by a player, no matter the side of the board--with any restrictions based on game rules. Captures are determined by <a href="game_params.html#capt_side">CAPT_SIDE</a> and hole ownership--not by side of the board. For example, if a player may only capture from their opponent's holes (per game rules), but their opponent owns a hole on their side of the board; its seeds may be captured by that player.
<p class="helptext"> In territory games, all holes are available for play each round, though the <a href="game_params.html#allow_rule">ALLOW_RULE</a> or <a href="game_params.html#mustshare">MUSTSHARE</a> may limit which holes may be played on any given turn.
<p class="helptext"> In a TERRITORY game without rounds, the winner is not declared until one player has enough seeds to claim goal_param holes.
<p class="helptext"> TERRITORY games require <a href="game_params.html#stores">STORES</a> and that <a href="game_params.html#goal_param">GOAL_PARAM</a> be set to a value between the number of holes and two times the number of holes. 
<p class="helptext"> TERRITORY games are incompatible with <a href="game_params.html#no_sides">NO_SIDES</a>, <a href="game_params.html#grandslam">GRANDSLAM</a> of NOT_LEGAL, <a href="game_params.html#allow_rule">ALLOW_RULE</a> of OPP_OR_EMPTY. Territory games may only use a <a href="game_params.html#round_fill">ROUND_FILL</a> of NOT_APPLICABLE or UCHOWN.
<li class="helptext">
<b class="enum">CLEAR</b>: clear seeds from your own holes.
<p class="helptext"> Moves must always be possible so <a href="game_params.html#min_move">MIN_MOVE</a> must be 1 and <a href="game_params.html#allow_rule">ALLOW_RULE</a> single_all_to_zero may not be used.
<p class="helptext"> <a href="game_params.html#grandslam">GRANDSLAM</a> must be legal for CLEAR games. CLEAR games cannot be played in <a href="game_params.html#rounds">ROUNDS</a> or use children.

<p>When rounds are employed, each round may end under conditions that do not win the overall game. The board is then setup again per the game rules, generally with some feature changed based on the previous round: hole ownership, holes out of play, a shortened board. Play continues in rounds until either player meets the overall game winning condition.
<p>If the game is played in rounds, it defines how each round ends: 
<ol start=0><li class="helptext">
<b class="enum">NO_ROUNDS</b>: the game is not played in rounds

<p>For example: In <a href="about_games.html#Weg">Weg</a>, each round ends when neither player has a valid move. The board is then set up again after determining who owns what territory (holes). Rounds continue until one player has claimed sufficient territory to be declared the game winner (e.g., ownership of 10 or more holes).
<p>In the case of a round win or tie a new starter is determined via <a href="game_params.html#round_starter">ROUND_STARTER</a> and  the board is reset according to <a href="game_params.html#round_fill">ROUND_FILL</a>.

<p>The round fill method determines which holes are filled and how many seeds they are filled with when setting up for a new round.
<p>Several round fill mechanisms use the same general approach called the Empty Hole Method. The loser of the previous round will end up with empty holes.

<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>The multiplier for the access scorer. The access scorer computes how many of the opponent's holes can be accessed for the given game state.
<p>The access scorer is slow and therefore is prohibited from being used in multilap games (<a href="game_params.html#mlaps">MLAPS</a>); games with user choice of move direction (<a href="game_params.html#udir_holes">UDIR_HOLES</a>); and games where hole owners are not predefined (<a href="game_params.html#no_sides">NO_SIDES</a>). In these game configurations, the multiplier must be zero to disable the access scorer.
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players.
<h4 id="seeds_m"> Seeds Multiplier </h4>

<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>The multiplier for the seeds scorer. The seeds scorer computes how many seeds each player has on the game board that are not in children.
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players.
<h4 id="empties_m"> Empties Multiplier </h4>
<p class="pdesc">Location in Config Files: player : scorer : empties_m
<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>The multiplier for the empties scorer. The empties scorer counts the number empty holes each player has on the board.
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players.
<h4 id="child_cnt_m"> Child Count Multiplier </h4>
<p class="pdesc">Location in Config Files: player : scorer : child_cnt_m
<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>The multiplier for the child scorer. The child scorer counts the number children each player has.
<p>The child scorer may only be used on games with children. If the game does not include children, the multiplier must be zero.
<p>Used only for the minimax & negamax players.
<h4 id="evens_m"> Evens Multiplier </h4>
<p class="pdesc">Location in Config Files: player : scorer : evens_m
<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>The multiplier for the even scorer. The even scorer counts the number of holes with an even number of seeds. This is useful to use when the capture mechanism is evens.
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players.
<h4 id="repeat_turn"> Repeat Turn Addin </h4>
<p class="pdesc">Location in Config Files: player : scorer : repeat_turn
<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>A value used to encourage or discourage repeat turns. The value is added in for the current player and subtracted off the score for the opposing playing. Use a positive value to encourage the AI player to repeat turns.
<p>This parameter may only be used for games in which repeated turns are possible (<a href="game_params.html#sow_own_store">SOW_OWN_STORE</a>, <a href="game_params.html#capt_rturn">CAPT_RTURN</a> or <a href="game_params.html#xc_sown">XC_SOWN</a>).
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players.
<h4 id="easy_rand"> Easy Random Addin </h4>
<p class="pdesc">Location in Config Files: player : scorer : easy_rand
<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>If the game is being played on easy mode (game difficult of easy/0), a random value may be added to the static evaluation. This can be done to induce errors into the ai player's game play. A random value is selected between -easy_rand and +easy_rand.
<p>The specific value for this should be selected based on the ranges of the parameters and multipliers.
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players.
