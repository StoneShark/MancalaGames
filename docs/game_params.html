<h1>Mancala Game Parameters</h1>
<p>Game options are provided in the following categories
(presented on corresponding tabs on the Mancala Game Editor):
<ul>
<li><a href="#tab_Game"><b class="inhead">Game</b></a>:
Provide high level information about a game: name, description,
size, setup, etc.
<li><a href="#tab_Dynamics"><b class="inhead">Dynamics</b></a>:
Parameters that provide some high level of control over how
game play is conducted and control which holes moves may be started from.
<li><a href="#tab_Sow"><b class="inhead">Sow</b></a>:
Parameters that control how the seeds are sown (moved around)
in the sow phase of a turn including the child parameters.
<li><a href="#tab_Capture"><b class="inhead">Capture</b></a>:
Parameters that control where seeds are captured from and
any special mechanisms for multiple captures.
<li><a href="#tab_Variants"><b class="inhead">Variants</b></a>:
Parameters that define available named variants and individually
adjustable parameters.

parameters that control how it selects moves
(see <a href="mancala_help.html#aiplayer"><b class="inhead">AI Player</b></a>).
</ul>
<p>An alphabetical parameter <a href="#index">index</a>
is included after the parameter sections.

<p>Each parameter description includes:
    <ul>
    <li>Location in Config File to describe where
    the parameter is defined in a Game Description file. The _all_params.txt
    file shows all game options and their default values.
    <li>Type of the parameter with a link to the Parameter Types help.
    <li>The default value for the parameter.
    If the default value is to be used the key-value pair is not needed
    in the game description file.
    Note that Mancala Game Editor has slightly different
    defaults to yield a playable game.
    <li>The Mancala Game Editor tab on which the parameter can be set.

<ul><li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">Mancala</b> 
<p class="helptext"> Allows setting all parameters. 
<p class="helptext"> Some combinations of parameters are not implemented   (NotImplementedError generated) or prohibited (GameInfoError   reported). Other combinations are not recommended and either   generate an actual warning (UserWarning) or a 'gentle warning' (a   print to the console--if there is one). 
<p class="helptext"> Most preconfigured games use this class. 
<li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">NorthSouthCycle</b> 
<p class="helptext"> A two-cycle game class in which each player only sows on their own   side of the board. If <a href="game_params.html#no_sides">NO_SIDES</a> is configured, either player may sow   on either side of the board, but the seeds will remain on that side   of the board. 
<p class="helptext"> Players may effect eachother's play with <a href="game_params.html#crosscapt">CROSSCAPT</a>, <a href="game_params.html#pickextra">PICKEXTRA</a>, Qur   <a href="game_params.html#child_type">CHILD_TYPE</a>, and others. 
<p class="helptext"> <a href="about_games.html#Weg">Weg</a> children are only supported for no_sides games.

<p class="helptext"> <a href="about_games.html#NS_Kalah">NS_Kalah</a> is a preconfigured game using this class. 
<li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">EastWestCycle</b> 
<p class="helptext"> A two-cycle game class in which player's control east and west   sides of the board, and seeds are sown in those cycles. 
<p class="helptext">  EWGratuitous is built on this class.   Without specialized extension of this game class, it appears to   only support race type games, e.g. who can clear their holes faster.   Their is little or no player interaction supported in the Mancala   Games engine. 
<li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">BearOff</b> 
<p class="helptext"> A flexible game class that does Backgammon-like bear off board   clearing after the game reaches a state where only singletons are   left. When a sow reaches the player's end of the board, any   remaining seeds in hand are removed from play (actually moved to   their store). 
<p class="helptext"> This is intendend for clear and deprive games, though this is not   enforced. It turns the end game into a race to see which player   accomplishes the goal first. 
<p class="helptext"> The transition from normal sow to bear-off sowing is made on the   first move when all of the seeds on the board are singletons (i.e.,   all holes <=1 seeds). Games may ended via an outright win before   this condition is achieved. 
<p class="helptext"> Even if a future moves starts with > 1 seeds in a hole, the normal   sow is not resumed. 
<p class="helptext"> <a href="game_params.html#no_sides">NO_SIDES</a> is not supported and <a href="game_params.html#min_move">MIN_MOVE</a> must be 1.  There are no   other limitations unique to the BearOff game class. 
<p class="helptext"> <a href="about_games.html#Andada">Andada</a> is a preconfigured game using this class. 
<li class="helptext">
<a href="about_games.html#Diffusion">Diffusion</a> (also a game) 
<p class="helptext"> A game class with has a unique sow method and win condition.   Players control the east/west sides of the board. 
<p class="helptext"> The game is basically preconfigured, only the board size can be   changed to any even size. Game goal must be CLEAR. 
<li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">DiffusionV2</b> 
<p class="helptext"> Like <nolink>Diffusion but players control the typical north/south   sides of the board. Used as a game variant in the game <a href="about_games.html#Diffusion">Diffusion</a>. 
<li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">NSGratuitous</b> 
<p class="helptext"> A game class in which seeds are only sown on the player's own side   of the board. If a capture is made, the capturer chooses one of   their opponent's holes to put the seeds into. All seeds go into   exactly one hole. 
<p class="helptext">  The game goal must be CLEAR.    Stores maybe included but they are only used to show whose turn it is.   Sow direction is unconstrained.   <a href="game_params.html#play_locs">PLAY_LOCS</a>, <a href="game_params.html#moveunlock">MOVEUNLOCK</a>, <a href="game_params.html#sow_stores">SOW_STORES</a>, <a href="game_params.html#sow_rule">SOW_RULE</a>, <a href="game_params.html#mlap_cont">MLAP_CONT</a>, <a href="game_params.html#capt_rturn">CAPT_RTURN</a>, and <a href="game_params.html#pickextra">PICKEXTRA</a> are    not supported with this game class.   Capture mechanisms must be limited to your own holes: basic   captures, next, and two out. 
<p class="helptext"> The example game <a href="about_games.html#SameSide">SameSide</a> uses this game class. 
<li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">EWGratuitous</b> 
<p class="helptext"> Like the NSGratuitous game class but the board is divided east/west instead   of north/south. 
<p class="helptext"> Restrictions from NSGratuitous apply to EWGratuitous. 
<p class="helptext"> <a href="about_games.html#Ohojichi">Ohojichi</a> is a preconfigured game using this class. 
<li class="helptext">
<b class="inhead">ShareOne</b> 
<p class="helptext"> A game class that forces a share of one seed when your opponent   does not have any seeds at the start of your turn. You may choose   which hole the seed comes from but it must be a hole with at least   two seeds. After sharing the one seed, the sharer gets a repeat   turn. 
<p class="helptext"> The following options are prohibited: <a href="game_params.html#blocks">BLOCKS</a>, <a href="game_params.html#mustshare">MUSTSHARE</a>, <a href="game_params.html#no_sides">NO_SIDES</a>,   or any repeat turn option (<a href="game_params.html#capt_rturn">CAPT_RTURN</a>, SOW_OWN_STORE, <a href="game_params.html#xc_sown">XC_SOWN</a> or   <a href="game_params.html#grandslam">GRANDSLAM</a> of LEGAL_SHARE). The game <a href="game_params.html#goal">GOAL</a> must not be TERRITORY. 
<li class="helptext">
<nolink><b class="inhead">ZigZag</b> 
<p class="helptext"> A flexible game class with a unique zigzag sowing pattern. See   the <a href="about_games.html#ZigZag">ZigZag</a> game help for details of the pattern and it's creators. 
<p class="helptext"> The sowing is done in a zigzag fashion: Sowing is done towards the   center line of the board. The first hole sown is one hole towards   the center and on the opposite side of the board, when the end of   the board is reached sow directly across from the last hole. The sow   pattern cycles through each hole of the board before visiting a hole   a second time. 
<p class="helptext"> Games with min_move of 1, no user directed sow direction holes,   and an even number of holes, will not allow a player to move a   single seed that was just moved across the center of the board back   across the board. This restriction only applies to the very next   turn. 
<p class="helptext"> <a href="game_params.html#sow_direct">SOW_DIRECT</a> must be TOCENTER. If the size of the board is odd, the   center hole must be in the User Chooses Direction list. There are no   other limitations unique to the <nolink>ZigZag game class.

<p>The overall goal of the game. Defines how a player wins. 
<p>Goals that start with RND_ are 'round tally games'. Multiple games are played and the overall winner is determined by the tally type (see the options below). 
<ol start=0><li class="helptext">
<b class="enum">MAX_SEEDS</b>: The goal is to collect the maximum number of seeds. 
<p class="helptext"> If the game is not played in rounds, the game will end when one   player has more than half of the total seeds. 
<p class="helptext"> If the game is played in rounds, the round end condition is   decided by <a href="game_params.html#rounds">ROUNDS</a>. These games end when one player has collected   sufficient seeds to prevent the opponent from filling the required   number of holes. Generally, the required number of holes is one, but   this may be increased by setting goal_param. 
<p class="helptext"> In MAX_SEEDS/ROUNDS games the player only controls the holes on   their side of the board, while, in TERRITORY games a player may   control holes on either side of the board. 
<li class="helptext">
<b class="enum">DEPRIVE</b>: eliminate all your opponent's seeds. If a player has no seeds at the start of their turn, they lose. If the current player doesn't have any seeds at the end of their turn, they lose. 
<p class="helptext"> <a href="game_params.html#grandslam">GRANDSLAM</a> must be legal for deprive games. 
<p class="helptext"> Deprive games can be played in tallied rounds--no other support   for rounds is provided. Use a goal of RND_WIN_COUNT_DEP. <a href="game_params.html#rounds">ROUNDS</a> must   be NO_MOVES, <a href="game_params.html#round_fill">ROUND_FILL</a> is ignored, and goal_param should be set to   the number of round wins required for a game win. For example, a   "best of 7 games" would have goal_param of 4. 
<p class="helptext"> Deprive games cannot use children and the following options are   prohibited: <a href="game_params.html#moveunlock">MOVEUNLOCK</a>, <a href="game_params.html#mustpass">MUSTPASS</a> and <a href="game_params.html#mustshare">MUSTSHARE</a>. 
<li class="helptext">
<b class="enum">TERRITORY</b>: claim ownership of holes by collecting more seeds than your opponent. Claiming ownership of goal_param holes wins the game. 
<p class="helptext"> Territory games are generally played in rounds. A winner is   declared for each round based on the condition set in <a href="game_params.html#rounds">ROUNDS</a>. 
<p class="helptext"> After each round, the ownership of holes is decided by the number   of seeds captured in the previous round. The winner's collected   seeds are used to fill as many holes as they can with <a href="game_params.html#nbr_start">NBR_START</a>   seeds, first on their own side of the board and then their   opponent's side.  Next, if they have more than half the seeds   required to fill another hole, ownership of one more hole is   allocated to them. The remaining holes are allocated to the round   loser. 
<p class="helptext"> This ownership of holes only applies to the next round played;   ownership of holes varies with each round played. Hole ownership may   be reclaimed or lost each round. 
<p class="helptext"> The Ownership Arrows Display option may be used to show hole   ownership with long thin arrows in each hole. The arrows point up   for the top/north player and down for the bottom/south player. If   facing players is set, the arrows point towards the hole owner. 
<p class="helptext"> A move maybe started from any hole owned by a player, no matter   the side of the board--with any restrictions based on game rules.   Captures are determined by <a href="game_params.html#capt_side">CAPT_SIDE</a> and hole ownership--not by side   of the board. For example, if a player may only capture from their   opponent's holes (per game rules), but their opponent owns a hole on   their side of the board; its seeds may be captured by that player. 
<p class="helptext"> In territory games, all holes are available for play each round,   though the <a href="game_params.html#allow_rule">ALLOW_RULE</a> or <a href="game_params.html#mustshare">MUSTSHARE</a> may limit which holes may be   played on any given turn. 
<p class="helptext"> In a territory game without rounds, the winner is not declared   until one player has enough seeds to claim goal_param holes. 
<p class="helptext"> Territory games require <a href="game_params.html#stores">STORES</a> and that <a href="game_params.html#goal_param">GOAL_PARAM</a> be set to a   value between the number of holes and two times the number of holes. 
<p class="helptext"> Territory games are incompatible with <a href="game_params.html#no_sides">NO_SIDES</a>, <a href="game_params.html#grandslam">GRANDSLAM</a> of   NOT_LEGAL, <a href="game_params.html#allow_rule">ALLOW_RULE</a> of OPP_OR_EMPTY.

<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>The multiplier for the stores scorer. Seeds in stores and children are included. 
<p>The stores scorer may not be used in games without <a href="game_params.html#stores">STORES</a> or CHILDREN. A zero multiplier disables the stores scorer.

<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>The multiplier for the access scorer. The access scorer computes how many of the opponent's holes can be accessed for the given game state. 
<p>The access scorer is slow and therefore is prohibited from being used in multilap games (<a href="game_params.html#mlaps">MLAPS</a>); games with user choice of move direction (<a href="game_params.html#udir_holes">UDIR_HOLES</a>); and games where hole owners are not predefined (<a href="game_params.html#no_sides">NO_SIDES</a>). In these game configurations, the multiplier must be zero to disable the access scorer. 
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players.

<p>The multiplier for the seeds scorer. The seeds scorer computes how many seeds each player has on the game board that are not in children. 
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players. 
<h4 id="mx_empties_m"> Empties Multiplier </h4>
<p class="pdesc">Location in Config Files: player : scorer : mx_empties_m
<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>The multiplier for the empties scorer. The empties scorer counts the number empty holes each player has on the board.

<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>The multiplier for the child scorer. The child scorer counts the number children each player has. 
<p>The child scorer may only be used on games with children. If the game does not include children, the multiplier must be zero. 
<p>Used only for the minimax & negamax players. 
<h4 id="mx_evens_m"> Evens Multiplier </h4>
<p class="pdesc">Location in Config Files: player : scorer : mx_evens_m
<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>The multiplier for the even scorer. The even scorer counts the number of holes with an even number of seeds. This is useful to use when the capture mechanism is evens. 
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players. 
<h4 id="mx_rturn_a"> Repeat Turn Addin </h4>
<p class="pdesc">Location in Config Files: player : scorer : mx_rturn_a
<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>A value used to encourage or discourage repeat turns. The value is added in for the current player and subtracted off the score for the opposing playing. Use a positive value to encourage the AI player to repeat turns. 
<p>This parameter may only be used for games in which repeated turns are possible (<a href="game_params.html#sow_stores">SOW_STORES</a>, <a href="game_params.html#capt_rturn">CAPT_RTURN</a> or <a href="game_params.html#xc_sown">XC_SOWN</a>). 
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players. 
<h4 id="mx_easy_rand_a"> Easy Random Addin </h4>
<p class="pdesc">Location in Config Files: player : scorer : mx_easy_rand_a
<p id="int" class="pdesc">Type: <a href="param_types.html#int"> int </a>
<p class="pdesc">Default value: 0
<p class="pdesc">UI Tab: Player

<p>If the game is being played on easy mode (game difficult of easy/0), a random value may be added to the static evaluation. This can be done to induce errors into the ai player's game play. A random value is selected between -mx_easy_rand_a and +easy_rand. 
<p>The specific value for this should be selected based on the ranges of the parameters and multipliers. 
<p>Used only for minimax & negamax players.
