Notes by game
==============================================================================================

** Azigo

Random play games generally don't end. 

Used board size 20,  default ai config, played 100 games, with each up to 20000 moves; all 100 ended. 
Fully fair. 

Board size 12, ai players, 20000 turns allowed, 4 of 100 games looped, none maxed, fully fair.



** Adji_Kui_II - DONE

Ran 20K trials - still problem
Ran 40K trials - still problem
combined results

rechecked rules (Valdez) - seems right
rules do not say who should start new rounds

Compare Ba-awa - ran 40K ... still judged fair
combined results

40k without capt_side  Still not fair

40K with pick 2x extra (as in Ba-awa) ... judged fair 
	this causes the round end last2x not to be used as in Ba-awa
significantly fewer endless sows 165/40000


** Bao - DONE

Both win and starter are judged NOT FAIR.

AI depth of 3 (diff 2) 100x more looped games.
Both win and starter are judged NOT FAIR.
Data not copied to summary (ai2_23.csv)

Four options unique to Bao:

1. Child Rule oppside not 1st with 1 OPPS_ONLY_NOT_1ST

2. Must visit opp for mlaps -- bug not likely

3. Prescribed opening ARNGE_LIMIT
	InhibitorBoth added
	capture inhibitor DECO added
	
4. Round Fill SHORTEN_ALL
	if not ARNGE_LIMIT, InhibitorChildrenOnly added
	always fill from WEST side of the board                 - TODO try EAST side fill??
	capture inhibitor DECO added

Setting the inhibitor to on is (when no seeds moved) is done in the UI (bhv_hold.py)
therefore the inhibitor is OFF for all trials--it should be ON.

SHORTEN versus SHORTEN_ALL makes the game fair
add a not to the game.


** Bule Perga -- DONE

allowed 20_000 moves per game still half didn't finish
ai players at default moves finish less than half the time

AI players & 20_000 moves still get 55 out of 100 maxing on turns

The final four seeds can easily end up in holes such that a final capture
is impossible. Ran the following options:
	pickextra	PICKLASTSEEDS
	pickextrea	PICK2XLASTSEEDS
	end_cond	SEEDS_LIMIT with END_PARAM = 4     Seems the best game shortening option. Games still don't finish in 500 moves need <=5000.
	end_cond	SEEDS_LIMIT with END_PARAM = 8
All maintain fair winner.
All seriously favor the starter as does the base game.


** Dabuda -- DONE

Both win and starter are judged NOT FAIR.

AI depth of 3 (diff 2) both true and starter win % drops drastically.
Both win and starter are judged NOT FAIR.
Data not copied to summary (ai2_23.csv)

Endodoi's only differences:
	- allow_rule of empty or opp.
	- board size.
Ran another 40K of it to confirm still fair. 

Dabuda on 8 hole board is fair.
Dabuda on 10 hole board but 5 start seeds per hole is fair.


** long_night_game - DONE

The are ties due to endless sows, but no_endless sow did not recude the tie percentage.
Which doesn't really matter.

The concern is that it is judged not FAIR.

Bug found in Occupied allowable deco!


** Four-Capture 

Ties are not due to endless sows.
Judged fair at 60_000 runs; it's fine.



** Ot'tjin

Ties are NOT due to endless sows.
